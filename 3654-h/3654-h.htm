<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> writing this brief sketch of the
Life of Tennyson, and this attempt to appreciate his work, I have
rested almost entirely on the Biography by Lord Tennyson (with
his kind permission) and on the text of the Poems.&nbsp; As to
the Life, doubtless current anecdotes, not given in the
Biography, are known to me, and to most people.&nbsp; But as they
must also be familiar to the author of the Biography, I have not
thought it desirable to include what he rejected.&nbsp; The works
of the &ldquo;localisers&rdquo; I have not read: Tennyson
disliked these researches, as a rule, and they appear to be
unessential, and often hazardous.&nbsp; The professed
commentators I have not consulted.&nbsp; It appeared better to
give one&rsquo;s own impressions of the Poems, unaffected by the
impressions of others, except in one or two cases where matters
of fact rather than of taste seemed to be in question.&nbsp; Thus
on two or three points I have ventured to differ from a
distinguished living critic, and have given the reasons for my
dissent.&nbsp; Professor Bradley&rsquo;s <i>Commentary on In
Memoriam</i> <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a> came out after this sketch was in
print.&nbsp; Many of the comments cited by Mr Bradley from his
predecessors appear to justify my neglect of these curious
inquirers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; which they raise
are not likely, as a rule, to present themselves to persons who
read poetry &ldquo;for human pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have not often dwelt on parallels to be found in the works
of earlier poets.&nbsp; In many cases Tennyson deliberately
reproduced passages from Greek, Latin, and old Italian writers,
just as Virgil did in the case of Homer, Theocritus, Apollonius
Rhodius, and others.&nbsp; There are, doubtless, instances in
which a phrase is unconsciously reproduced by automatic memory,
from an English poet.&nbsp; But I am less inclined than Mr
Bradley to think that unconscious reminiscence is more common in
Tennyson than in the poets generally.&nbsp; I have not closely
examined Keats and Shelley, for example, to see how far they were
influenced by unconscious memory.&nbsp; But Scott, confessedly,
was apt to reproduce the phrases of others, and once unwittingly
borrowed from a poem by the valet of one of his friends!&nbsp; I
believe that many of the alleged borrowings in Tennyson are
either no true parallels at all or are the unavoidable
coincidences of expression which must inevitably occur.&nbsp; The
poet himself stated, in a lively phrase, his opinion of the
hunters after parallels, and I confess that I am much of his
mind.&nbsp; They often remind me of Mr Punch&rsquo;s parody on an
unfriendly review of Alexander Smith&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Most <i>women</i> have <i>no character</i>
at all.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No <i>character</i> that servant <i>woman</i>
asked.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Smith</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to thank Mr Edmund Gosse and Mr Vernon Rendall for
their kindness in reading my proof-sheets.&nbsp; They have saved
me from some errors, but I may have occasionally retained matter
which, for one reason or another, did not recommend itself to
them.&nbsp; In no case are they responsible for the opinions
expressed, or for the critical estimates.&nbsp; They are those of
a Tennysonian, and, no doubt, would be other than they are if the
writer were younger than he is.&nbsp; It does not follow that
they would necessarily be more correct, though probably they
would be more in vogue.&nbsp; The point of view must shift with
each generation of readers, as ideas or beliefs go in or out of
fashion, are accepted, rejected, or rehabilitated.&nbsp; To one
age Tennyson may seem weakly superstitious; to another needlessly
sceptical.&nbsp; After all, what he must live by is, not his
opinions, but his poetry.&nbsp; The poetry of Milton survives his
ideas; whatever may be the fate of the ideas of Tennyson his
poetry must endure.</p>

BOYHOOD&mdash;CAMBRIDGE&mdash;EARLY POEMS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life and work of Tennyson
present something like the normal type of what, in circumstances
as fortunate as mortals may expect, the life and work of a modern
poet ought to be.&nbsp; A modern poet, one says, because even
poetry is now affected by the division of labour.&nbsp; We do not
look to the poet for a large share in the practical activities of
existence: we do not expect him, like &AElig;schylus and
Sophocles, Theognis and Alc&aelig;us, to take a conspicuous part
in politics and war; or even, as in the Age of Anne, to shine
among wits and in society.&nbsp; Life has become, perhaps, too
specialised for such multifarious activities.&nbsp; Indeed, even
in ancient days, as a Celtic proverb and as the picture of life
in the Homeric epics prove, the poet was already a man
apart&mdash;not foremost among statesmen and rather backward
among warriors.&nbsp; If we agree with a not unpopular opinion,
the poet ought to be a kind of &ldquo;Titanic&rdquo; force,
wrecking himself on his own passions and on the nature of things,
as did Byron, Burns, Marlowe, and Musset.&nbsp; But
Tennyson&rsquo;s career followed lines really more normal, the
lines of the life of Wordsworth, wisdom and self-control
directing the course of a long, sane, sound, and fortunate
existence.&nbsp; The great physical strength which is commonly
the basis of great mental vigour was not ruined in Tennyson by
poverty and passion, as in the case of Burns, nor in forced
literary labour, as in those of Scott and Dickens.&nbsp; For long
he was poor, like Wordsworth and Southey, but never
destitute.&nbsp; He made his early effort: he had his time of
great sorrow, and trial, and apparent failure.&nbsp; With
practical wisdom he conquered circumstances; he became eminent;
he outlived reaction against his genius; he died in the fulness
of a happy age and of renown.&nbsp; This full-orbed life, with
not a few years of sorrow and stress, is what Nature seems to
intend for the career of a divine minstrel.&nbsp; If Tennyson
missed the &ldquo;one crowded hour of glorious life,&rdquo; he
had not to be content in &ldquo;an age without a name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not Tennyson&rsquo;s lot to illustrate any modern
theory of the origin of genius.&nbsp; Born in 1809 of a
Lincolnshire family, long connected with the soil but
inconspicuous in history, Tennyson had nothing Celtic in his
blood, as far as pedigrees prove.&nbsp; This is unfortunate for
one school of theorists.&nbsp; His mother (genius is presumed to
be derived from mothers) had a genius merely for moral excellence
and for religion.&nbsp; She is described in the poem of
<i>Isabel</i>, and was &ldquo;a remarkable and saintly
woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the male line, the family was not (as the
families of genius ought to be) brief of life and
unhealthy.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Tennysons never die,&rdquo; said the
sister who was betrothed to Arthur Hallam.&nbsp; The father, a
clergyman, was, says his grandson, &ldquo;a man of great
ability,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;excellent library&rdquo; was an
element in the education of his family.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father
was a poet,&rdquo; Tennyson said, &ldquo;and could write regular
verse very skilfully.&rdquo;&nbsp; In physical type the sons were
tall, strong, and unusually dark: Tennyson, when abroad, was not
taken for an Englishman; at home, strangers thought him
&ldquo;foreign.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most of the children had the
temperament, and several of the sons had some of the
accomplishments, of genius: whence derived by way of heredity is
a question beyond conjecture, for the father&rsquo;s
accomplishment was not unusual.&nbsp; As Walton says of the poet
and the angler, they &ldquo;were born to be so&rdquo;: we know no
more.</p>
<p>The region in which the paternal hamlet of Somersby lies,
&ldquo;a land of quiet villages, large fields, grey hillsides,
and noble tall-towered churches, on the lower slope of a
Lincolnshire wold,&rdquo; does not appear to have been rich in
romantic legend and tradition.&nbsp; The folk-lore of
Lincolnshire, of which examples have been published, does seem to
have a peculiar poetry of its own, but it was rather the humorous
than the poetical aspect of the country-people that Tennyson
appears to have known.&nbsp; In brief, we have nothing to inform
us as to how genius came into that generation of Tennysons which
was born between 1807 and 1819.&nbsp; A source and a cause there
must have been, but these things are hidden, except from popular
science.</p>
<p>Precocity is not a sign of genius, but genius is perhaps
always accompanied by precocity.&nbsp; This is especially notable
in the cases of painting, music, and mathematics; but in the
matter of literature genius may chiefly show itself in
acquisition, as in Sir Walter Scott, who when a boy knew much,
but did little that would attract notice.&nbsp; As a child and a
boy young Tennyson was remarked both for acquisition and
performance.&nbsp; His own reminiscences of his childhood varied
somewhat in detail.&nbsp; In one place we learn that at the age
of eight he covered a slate with blank verse in the manner of
Jamie Thomson, the only poet with whom he was then
acquainted.&nbsp; In another passage he says, &ldquo;The first
poetry that moved me was my own at five years old.&nbsp; When I
was eight I remember making a line I thought grander than
Campbell, or Byron, or Scott.&nbsp; I rolled it out, it was
this&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;With slaughterous sons of thunder rolled
the flood&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>great nonsense, of course, but I thought it fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> fine, and was thoroughly Tennysonian.&nbsp;
Scott, Campbell, and Byron probably never produced a line with
the qualities of this nonsense verse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before I could
read I was in the habit on a stormy day of spreading my arms to
the wind and crying out, &lsquo;I hear a voice that&rsquo;s
speaking in the wind,&rsquo; and the words &lsquo;far, far
away&rsquo; had always a strange charm for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
late lyric has this overword, <i>Far</i>, <i>far away</i>!</p>
<p>A boy of eight who knew the contemporary poets was more or
less precocious.&nbsp; Tennyson also knew Pope, and wrote
hundreds of lines in Pope&rsquo;s measure.&nbsp; At twelve the
boy produced an epic, in Scott&rsquo;s manner, of some six
thousand lines.&nbsp; He &ldquo;never felt himself more truly
inspired,&rdquo; for the sense of &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; (as
the late Mr Myers has argued in an essay on the &ldquo;Mechanism
of Genius&rdquo;) has little to do with the actual value of the
product.&nbsp; At fourteen Tennyson wrote a drama in blank
verse.&nbsp; A chorus from this play (as one guesses), a piece
from &ldquo;an unpublished drama written very early,&rdquo; is
published in the volume of 1830:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The varied earth, the moving heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rapid waste of roving sea,<br />
The fountain-pregnant mountains riven<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To shapes of wildest anarchy,<br />
By secret fire and midnight storms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That wander round their windy cones.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These lines are already Tennysonian.&nbsp; There is the
classical transcript, &ldquo;the varied earth,&rdquo;
<i>d&aelig;dala tellus</i>.&nbsp; There is the geological
interest in the forces that shape the hills.&nbsp; There is the
use of the favourite word &ldquo;windy,&rdquo; and later in the
piece&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The troublous autumn&rsquo;s <i>sallow</i>
gloom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The young poet from boyhood was original in his manner.</p>
<p>Byron made him <i>blas&eacute;</i> at fourteen.&nbsp; Then
Byron died, and Tennyson scratched on a rock &ldquo;Byron is
dead,&rdquo; on &ldquo;a day when the whole world seemed darkened
for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later he considered Byron&rsquo;s poetry
&ldquo;too much akin to rhetoric.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Byron is
not an artist or a thinker, or a creator in the higher sense, but
a strong personality; he is endlessly clever, and is now unduly
depreciated.&rdquo;&nbsp; He &ldquo;did give the world another
heart and new pulses, and so we are kept going.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
&ldquo;he was dominated by Byron till he was seventeen, when he
put him away altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his boyhood, despite the sufferings which he endured for a
while at school at Louth; despite bullying from big boys and
masters, Tennyson would &ldquo;shout his verses to the
skies.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Arthur, I mean to be
famous,&rdquo; he used to say to one of his brothers.&nbsp; He
observed nature very closely by the brook and the thundering
sea-shores: he was never a sportsman, and his angling was in the
manner of the lover of <i>The Miller&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.&nbsp;
He was seventeen (1826) when <i>Poems by Two Brothers</i>
(himself and his brother Frederick) was published with the date
1827.&nbsp; These poems contain, as far as I have been able to
discover, nothing really Tennysonian.&nbsp; What he had done in
his own manner was omitted, &ldquo;being thought too much out of
the common for the public taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young poet had
already saving common-sense, and understood the public.&nbsp;
Fragments of the true gold are found in the volume of 1830,
others are preserved in the Biography.&nbsp; The ballad suggested
by <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i> was not unworthy of Beddoes,
and that novel, one cannot but think, suggested the opening
situation in <i>Maud</i>, where the hero is a modern Master of
Ravenswood in his relation to the rich interloping family and the
beautiful daughter.&nbsp; To this point we shall return.&nbsp; It
does not appear that Tennyson was conscious in <i>Maud</i> of the
suggestion from Scott, and the coincidence may be merely
accidental.</p>
<p><i>The Lover&rsquo;s Tale</i>, published in 1879, was mainly a
work of the poet&rsquo;s nineteenth year.&nbsp; A few copies had
been printed for friends.&nbsp; One of these, with errors of the
press, and without the intended alterations, was pirated by an
unhappy man in 1875.&nbsp; In old age Tennyson brought out the
work of his boyhood.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was written before I had
ever seen Shelley, though it is called Shelleyan,&rdquo; he said;
and indeed he believed that his work had never been imitative,
after his earliest efforts in the manner of Thomson and of
Scott.&nbsp; The only things in <i>The Lover&rsquo;s Tale</i>
which would suggest that the poet here followed Shelley are the
Italian scene of the story, the character of the versification,
and the extraordinary luxuriance and exuberance of the imagery.
<a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; As early as 1868 Tennyson heard
that written copies of <i>The Lover&rsquo;s Tale</i> were in
circulation.&nbsp; He then remarked, as to the exuberance of the
piece: &ldquo;Allowance must be made for abundance of
youth.&nbsp; It is rich and full, but there are mistakes in it. .
. . The poem is the breath of young love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How truly Tennysonian the manner is may be understood even
from the opening lines, full of the original cadences which were
to become so familiar:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here far away, seen from the topmost
cliff,<br />
Filling with purple gloom the vacancies<br />
Between the tufted hills, the sloping seas<br />
Hung in mid-heaven, and half way down rare sails,<br />
White as white clouds, floated from sky to sky.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The narrative in parts one and two (which alone were written
in youth) is so choked with images and descriptions as to be
almost obscure.&nbsp; It is the story, practically, of a love
like that of Paul and Virginia, but the love is not returned by
the girl, who prefers the friend of the narrator.&nbsp; Like the
hero of <i>Maud</i>, the speaker has a period of madness and
illusion; while the third part, &ldquo;The Golden
Supper&rdquo;&mdash;suggested by a story of Boccaccio, and
written in maturity&mdash;is put in the mouth of another
narrator, and is in a different style.&nbsp; The discarded lover,
visiting the vault which contains the body of his lady, finds her
alive, and restores her to her husband.&nbsp; The whole finished
legend is necessarily not among the author&rsquo;s
masterpieces.&nbsp; But perhaps not even Keats in his earliest
work displayed more of promise, and gave more assurance of
genius.&nbsp; Here and there come turns and phrases, &ldquo;all
the charm of all the Muses,&rdquo; which remind a reader of
things later well known in pieces more mature.&nbsp; Such lines
are&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Strange to me and
sweet,<br />
Sweet through strange years,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like to a low-hung and a fiery sky<br />
Hung round with <i>ragged rims</i> and burning folds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like sounds without the twilight realm of
dreams,<br />
Which wander round the bases of the hills.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also note close observation of nature in the curious
phrase&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cries of the partridge like a rusty key<br
/>
Turned in a lock.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of this kind was Tennyson&rsquo;s adolescent vein, when he
left</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The poplars four<br />
That stood beside his father&rsquo;s door,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the Somersby brook, and the mills and granges, the seas of the
Lincolnshire coast, and the hills and dales among the wolds, for
Cambridge.&nbsp; He was well read in old and contemporary English
literature, and in the classics.&nbsp; Already he was acquainted
with the singular trance-like condition to which his poems
occasionally allude, a subject for comment later.&nbsp; He
matriculated at Trinity, with his brother Charles, on February
20, 1828, and had an interview of a not quite friendly sort with
a proctor before he wore the gown.</p>
<p>That Tennyson should go to Cambridge, not to Oxford, was part
of the nature of things, by which Cambridge educates the majority
of English poets, whereas Oxford has only &ldquo;turned
out&rdquo; a few&mdash;like Shelley.&nbsp; At that time, as in
Macaulay&rsquo;s day, the path of university honours at Cambridge
lay through Mathematics, and, except for his prize poem in 1829,
Tennyson took no honours at all.&nbsp; His classical reading was
pursued as literature, not as a course of grammar and
philology.&nbsp; No English poet, at least since Milton, had been
better read in the classics; but Tennyson&rsquo;s studies did not
aim at the gaining of academic distinction.&nbsp; His aspect was
such that Thompson, later Master of Trinity, on first seeing him
come into hall, said, &ldquo;That man must be a
poet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like Byron, Shelley, and probably Coleridge,
Tennyson looked the poet that he was: &ldquo;Six feet high,
broad-chested, strong-limbed, his face Shakespearian and with
deep eyelids, his forehead ample, crowned with dark wavy hair,
his head finely poised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not much is recorded of Tennyson as an undergraduate.&nbsp; In
our days efforts would have been made to enlist so promising a
recruit in one of the college boats; but rowing was in its
infancy.&nbsp; It is a peculiarity of the universities that
little flocks of men of unusual ability come up at intervals
together, breaking the monotony of idlers, prize scholars, and
honours men.&nbsp; Such a group appeared at Balliol in Matthew
Arnold&rsquo;s time, and rather later, at various colleges, in
the dawn of Pre-Raphaelitism.&nbsp; The Tennysons&mdash;Alfred,
Frederick, and Charles&mdash;were members of such a set.&nbsp;
There was Arthur Hallam, son of the historian, from Eton; there
was Spedding, the editor and biographer of Bacon; Milnes (Lord
Houghton), Blakesley (Dean of Lincoln), Thompson, Merivale,
Trench (a poet, and later, Archbishop of Dublin), Brookfield,
Buller, and, after Tennyson the greatest, Thackeray, a
contemporary if not an &ldquo;Apostle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charles
Buller&rsquo;s, like Hallam&rsquo;s, was to be an
&ldquo;unfulfilled renown.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of Hallam, whose name is
for ever linked with his own, Tennyson said that he would have
been a great man, but not a great poet; &ldquo;he was as near
perfection as mortal man could be.&rdquo;&nbsp; His scanty
remains are chiefly notable for his divination of Tennyson as a
great poet; for the rest, we can only trust the author of <i>In
Memoriam</i> and the verdict of tradition.</p>
<p>The studies of the poet at this time included original
composition in Greek and Latin verse, history, and a theme that
he alone has made poetical, natural science.&nbsp; All poetry has
its roots in the age before natural science was more than a
series of nature-myths.&nbsp; The poets have usually, like Keats,
regretted the days when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was an awful rainbow once in
heaven,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when the hills and streams were not yet &ldquo;dispeopled of
their dreams.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tennyson, on the other hand, was
already finding material for poetry in the world as seen through
microscope and telescope, and as developed through
&ldquo;&aelig;onian&rdquo; processes of evolution.&nbsp; In a
notebook, mixed with Greek, is a poem on the Moon&mdash;not the
moon of Selene, &ldquo;the orbed Maiden,&rdquo; but of
astronomical science.&nbsp; <i>In Memoriam</i> recalls the
conversations on labour and politics, discussions of the age of
the Reform Bill, of rick-burning (expected to &ldquo;make taters
cheaper&rdquo;), and of Catholic emancipation; also the
emancipation of such negroes as had not yet tasted the blessings
of freedom.&nbsp; In politics Tennyson was what he remained, a
patriot, a friend of freedom, a foe of disorder.&nbsp; His
politics, he said, were those &ldquo;of Shakespeare, Bacon, and
every sane man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was one of the Society of
Apostles, and characteristically contributed an essay on
Ghosts.&nbsp; Only the preface survives: it is not written in a
scientific style; but bids us &ldquo;not assume that any vision
<i>is</i> baseless.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps the author went on to
discuss &ldquo;veridical hallucinations,&rdquo; but his ideas
about these things must be considered later.</p>
<p>It was by his father&rsquo;s wish that Tennyson competed for
the English prize poem.&nbsp; The theme, Timbuctoo, was not
inspiring.&nbsp; Thackeray wrote a good parody of the ordinary
prize poem in Pope&rsquo;s metre:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I see her sons the hill of glory mount,<br
/>
And sell their sugars on their own account;<br />
Prone to her feet the prostrate nations come,<br />
Sue for her rice and barter for her rum.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tennyson&rsquo;s work was not much more serious: he merely
patched up an old piece, in blank verse, on the battle of
Armageddon.&nbsp; The poem is not destitute of Tennysonian
cadence, and ends, not inappropriately, with &ldquo;All was
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, all <i>was</i> night.</p>
<p>An ingenious myth accounts for Tennyson&rsquo;s success: At
Oxford, says Charles Wordsworth, the author was more likely to
have been rusticated than rewarded.&nbsp; But already (1829)
Arthur Hallam told Mr Gladstone that Tennyson &ldquo;promised
fair to be the greatest poet of our generation, perhaps of our
century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1830 Tennyson published the first volume of which he was
sole author.&nbsp; Browning&rsquo;s <i>Pauline</i> was of the
year 1833.&nbsp; It was the very dead hours of the Muses.&nbsp;
The great Mr Murray had ceased, as one despairing of song, to
publish poetry.&nbsp; Bulwer Lytton, in the preface to <i>Paul
Clifford</i> (1830), announced that poetry, with every other form
of literature except the Novel, was unremunerative and
unread.&nbsp; Coleridge and Scott were silent: indeed Sir Walter
was near his death; Wordsworth had shot his bolt, though an arrow
or two were left in the quiver.&nbsp; Keats, Shelley, and Byron
were dead; Milman&rsquo;s brief vogue was departing.&nbsp; It
seemed as if novels alone could appeal to readers, so great a
change in taste had been wrought by the sixteen years of Waverley
romances.&nbsp; The slim volume of Tennyson was naturally
neglected, though Leigh Hunt reviewed it in the
<i>Tatler</i>.&nbsp; Hallam&rsquo;s comments in the
<i>Englishman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, though enthusiastic (as was
right and natural), were judicious.&nbsp; &ldquo;The author
imitates no one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Coleridge did not read all the
book, but noted &ldquo;things of a good deal of beauty.&nbsp; The
misfortune is that he has begun to write verses without very well
understanding what metre is.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Tennyson said in
1890, &ldquo;So I, an old man, who get a poem or poems every day,
might cast a casual glance at a book, and seeing something which
I could not scan or understand, might possibly decide against the
book without further consideration.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a rule, the
said books are worthless.&nbsp; The number of versifiers makes it
hard, indeed, for the poet to win recognition.&nbsp; One little
new book of rhyme is so like another, and almost all are of so
little interest!</p>
<p>The rare book that differs from the rest has a
<i>bizarrerie</i> with its originality, and in the poems of 1830
there was, assuredly, more than enough of the bizarre.&nbsp;
There were no hyphens in the double epithets, and words like
&ldquo;tendriltwine&rdquo; seemed provokingly affected.&nbsp; A
kind of lusciousness, like that of Keats when under the influence
of Leigh Hunt, may here and there be observed.&nbsp; Such faults
as these catch the indifferent eye when a new book is first
opened, and the volume of 1830 was probably condemned by almost
every reader of the previous generation who deigned to afford it
a glance.&nbsp; Out of fifty-six pieces only twenty-three were
reprinted in the two volumes of 1842, which won for Tennyson the
general recognition of the world of letters.&nbsp; Five or six of
the pieces then left out were added as <i>Juvenilia</i> in the
collected works of 1871, 1872.&nbsp; The whole mass deserves the
attention of students of the poet&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>This early volume may be said to contain, in the germ, all the
great original qualities of Tennyson, except the humour of his
rural studies and the elaboration of his Idylls.&nbsp; For
example, in <i>Mariana</i> we first note what may be called his
perfection and accomplishment.&nbsp; The very few alterations
made later are verbal.&nbsp; The moated grange of Mariana in
<i>Measure for Measure</i>, and her mood of desertion and
despair, are elaborated by a precision of truth and with a
perfection of harmony worthy of Shakespeare himself, and minutely
studied from the natural scenes in which the poet was born.&nbsp;
If these verses alone survived out of the wreck of Victorian
literature, they would demonstrate the greatness of the author as
clearly as do the fragments of Sappho.&nbsp; <i>Isabel</i> (a
study of the poet&rsquo;s mother) is almost as remarkable in its
stately dignity; while <i>Recollections of the Arabian Nights</i>
attest the power of refined luxury in romantic description, and
herald the unmatched beauty of <i>The Lotos-Eaters</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The Poet</i>, again, is a picture of that which Tennyson
himself was to fulfil; and <i>Oriana</i> is a revival of romance,
and of the ballad, not limited to the ballad form as in its
prototype, <i>Helen of Kirkconnell</i>.&nbsp; Curious and
exquisite experiment in metre is indicated in the <i>Leonine
Elegiacs</i>, in <i>Claribel</i>, and several other poems.&nbsp;
Qualities which were not for long to find public expression,
speculative powers brooding, in various moods, on ultimate and
insoluble questions, were attested by <i>The Mystic</i>, and
<i>Supposed Confessions of a Second-rate Sensitive Mind not in
Unity with Itself</i>, an unlucky title of a remarkable
performance.&nbsp; &ldquo;In this, the most agitated of all his
poems, we find the soul urging onward</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Thro&rsquo; utter dark a full-sail&rsquo;d
skiff,<br />
Unpiloted i&rsquo; the echoing dance<br />
Of reboant whirlwinds;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and to the question, &lsquo;Why not believe, then?&rsquo; we
have as answer a simile of the sea, which cannot slumber like a
mountain tarn, or</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Draw down into his vexed pools<br />
All that blue heaven which hues and paves&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the tranquil inland mere.&rdquo; <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p>The poet longs for the faith of his infant days and of his
mother&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thy mild deep eyes upraised, that knew<br
/>
The beauty and repose of faith,<br />
And the clear spirit shining thro&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That faith is already shaken, and the long struggle for belief
has already begun.</p>
<p>Tennyson, according to Matthew Arnold, was not <i>un esprit
puissant</i>.&nbsp; Other and younger critics, who have attained
to a cock-certain mood of negation, are apt to blame him because,
in fact, he did not finally agree with their opinions.&nbsp; If a
man is necessarily a weakling or a hypocrite because, after
trying all things, he is not an atheist or a materialist, then
the reproach of insincerity or of feebleness of mind must rest
upon Tennyson.&nbsp; But it is manifest that, almost in boyhood,
he had already faced the ideas which, to one of his character,
almost meant despair: he had not kept his eyes closed.&nbsp; To
his extremely self-satisfied accusers we might answer, in lines
from this earliest volume (<i>The Mystic</i>):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ye scorn him with an undiscerning scorn;<br
/>
Ye cannot read the marvel in his eye,<br />
The still serene abstraction.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He would behold</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One shadow in the midst of a great
light,<br />
One reflex from eternity on time,<br />
One mighty countenance of perfect calm,<br />
Awful with most invariable eyes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His mystic of these boyish years&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Often lying broad awake,
and yet<br />
Remaining from the body, and apart<br />
In intellect and power and will, hath heard<br />
Time flowing in the middle of the night,<br />
And all things creeping to a day of doom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this poem, never republished by the author, is an attempt
to express an experience which in later years he more than once
endeavoured to set forth in articulate speech, an experience
which was destined to colour his finial speculations on ultimate
problems of God and of the soul.&nbsp; We shall later have to
discuss the opinion of an eminent critic, Mr Frederic Harrison,
that Tennyson&rsquo;s ideas, theological, evolutionary, and
generally speculative, &ldquo;followed, rather than created, the
current ideas of his time.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The train of
thought&rdquo; (in <i>In Memoriam</i>), writes Mr Harrison,
&ldquo;is essentially that with which ordinary English readers
had been made familiar by F. D. Maurice, Professor Jowett, Dr
Martineau, <i>Ecce Homo</i>, <i>Hypatia</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of
these influences only Maurice, and Maurice only orally, could
have reached the author of <i>The Mystic</i> and the <i>Supposed
Confessions</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ecce Homo</i>, <i>Hypatia</i>, Mr
Jowett, were all in the bosom of the future when <i>In
Memoriam</i> was written.&nbsp; Now, <i>The Mystic</i> and the
<i>Supposed Confessions</i> are prior to <i>In Memoriam</i>,
earlier than 1830.&nbsp; Yet they already contain the chief
speculative tendencies of <i>In Memoriam</i>; the growing doubts
caused by evolutionary ideas (then familiar to Tennyson, though
not to &ldquo;ordinary English readers&rdquo;), the longing for a
return to childlike faith, and the mystical experiences which
helped Tennyson to recover a faith that abode with him.&nbsp; In
these things he was original.&nbsp; Even as an undergraduate he
was not following &ldquo;a train of thought made familiar&rdquo;
by authors who had not yet written a line, and by books which had
not yet been published.</p>
<p>So much, then, of the poet that was to be and of the
philosopher existed in the little volume of the
undergraduate.&nbsp; In <i>The Mystic</i> we notice a phrase, two
words long, which was later to be made familiar, &ldquo;Daughters
of time, divinely tall,&rdquo; reproduced in the picture of
Helen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A daughter of the Gods, divinely tall,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And most divinely fair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reflective pieces are certainly of more interest now
(though they seem to have satisfied the poet less) than the
gallery of airy fairy Lilians, Adelines, Rosalinds, and
Ele&auml;nores:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Daughters of dreams and of
stories,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>like</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Faustine, Fragoletta, Dolores,<br />
F&eacute;lise, and Yolande, and Juliette.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cambridge, which he was soon to leave, did not satisfy the
poet.&nbsp; Oxford did not satisfy Gibbon, or later, Shelley; and
young men of genius are not, in fact, usually content with
universities which, perhaps, are doing their best, but are
neither governed nor populated by minds of the highest and most
original class.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You that do profess to
teach<br />
And teach us nothing, feeding not the heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The universities, in fact, teach a good deal of that which can
be learned, but the best things cannot be taught.&nbsp; The
universities give men leisure, books, and companionship, to learn
for themselves.&nbsp; All tutors cannot be, and at that time few
dreamed of being, men like Jowett and T. H. Green, Gamaliels at
whose feet undergraduates sat with enthusiasm, &ldquo;did
<i>eagerly</i> frequent,&rdquo; like Omar Khayy&aacute;m.&nbsp;
In later years Tennyson found closer relations between dons and
undergraduates, and recorded his affection for his
university.&nbsp; She had supplied him with such companionship as
is rare, and permitted him to &ldquo;catch the blossom of the
flying terms,&rdquo; even if tutors and lecturers were creatures
of routine, <i>terriblement enfonces dans la mati&egrave;re</i>,
like the sire of Madelon and Cathos, that honourable citizen.</p>
<p>Tennyson just missed, by going down, a visit of Wordsworth to
Cambridge.&nbsp; The old enthusiast of revolution was justifying
passive obedience: thirty years had turned the almost Jacobin
into an almost Jacobite.&nbsp; Such is the triumph of time.&nbsp;
In the summer of 1830 Tennyson, with Hallam, visited the
Pyrenees.&nbsp; The purpose was political&mdash;to aid some
Spanish rebels.&nbsp; The fruit is seen in <i>&OElig;none</i> and
<i>Mariana in the South</i>.</p>
<p>In March 1831 Tennyson lost his father.&nbsp; &ldquo;He slept
in the dead man&rsquo;s bed, earnestly desiring to see his ghost,
but no ghost came.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;ghosts do not generally come to imaginative people;&rdquo;
a remark very true, though ghosts are attributed to
&ldquo;imagination.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever causes these phantasms,
it is not the kind of <i>phantasia</i> which is consciously
exercised by the poet.&nbsp; Coleridge had seen far too many
ghosts to believe in them; and Coleridge and Donne apart, with
the hallucinations of Goethe and Shelley, who met themselves,
what poet ever did &ldquo;see a ghost&rdquo;?&nbsp; One who saw
Tennyson as he wandered alone at this period called him &ldquo;a
mysterious being, seemingly lifted high above other mortals, and
having a power of intercourse with the spirit world not granted
to others.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it was the world of the poet, not of
the &ldquo;medium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tennysons stayed on at the parsonage for six years.&nbsp;
But, anticipating their removal, Arthur Hallam in 1831 dealt in
prophecy about the identification in the district of places in
his friend&rsquo;s poems&mdash;&ldquo;critic after critic will
trace the wanderings of the brook,&rdquo; as,&mdash;in fact,
critic after critic has done.&nbsp; Tennyson disliked&mdash;these
&ldquo;localisers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s walks were
shared by Arthur Hallam, then affianced to his sister Emily.</p>

POEMS OF 1831&ndash;1833.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> 1832 most of the poems of
Tennyson&rsquo;s second volume were circulating in MS. among his
friends, and no poet ever had friends more encouraging.&nbsp;
Perhaps bards of to-day do not find an eagerness among their
acquaintance for effusions in manuscript, or in
proof-sheets.&nbsp; The charmed volume appeared at the end of the
year (dated 1833), and Hallam denounced as &ldquo;infamous&rdquo;
Lockhart&rsquo;s review in the <i>Quarterly</i>.&nbsp; Infamous
or not, it is extremely diverting.&nbsp; How Lockhart could miss
the great and abundant poetry remains a marvel.&nbsp; Ten years
later the Scorpion repented, and invited Sterling to review any
book he pleased, for the purpose of enabling him to praise the
two volumes of 1842, which he did gladly.&nbsp; Lockhart hated
all affectation and &ldquo;preciosity,&rdquo; of which the new
book was not destitute.&nbsp; He had been among
Wordsworth&rsquo;s most ardent admirers when Wordsworth had few,
but the memories of the war with the &ldquo;Cockney School&rdquo;
clung to him, the war with Leigh Hunt, and now he gave himself up
to satire.&nbsp; Probably he thought that the poet was a member
of a London clique.&nbsp; There is really no excuse for Lockhart,
except that he <i>did</i> repent, that much of his banter was
amusing, and that, above all, his censures were accepted by the
poet, who altered, later, many passages of a fine absurdity
criticised by the infamous reviewer.&nbsp; One could name great
prose-writers, historians, who never altered the wondrous errors
to which their attention was called by critics.&nbsp;
Prose-writers have been more sensitively attached to their
glaring blunders in verifiable facts than was this very sensitive
poet to his occasional lapses in taste.</p>
<p><i>The Lady of Shalott</i>, even in its early form, was more
than enough to give assurance of a poet.&nbsp; In effect it is
even more poetical, in a mysterious way, if infinitely less
human, than the later treatment of the same or a similar legend
in <i>Elaine</i>.&nbsp; It has the charm of Coleridge, and an
allegory of the fatal escape from the world of dreams and shadows
into that of realities may have been really present to the mind
of the young poet, aware that he was &ldquo;living in
phantasy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The alterations are usually for the
better.&nbsp; The daffodil is not an aquatic plant, as the poet
seems to assert in the first form&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The yellow-leav&egrave;d water-lily,<br />
The green sheathed daffodilly,<br />
Tremble in the water chilly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round about Shalott.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody can prefer to keep</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though the squally east wind keenly<br />
Blew, with folded arms serenely<br />
By the water stood the queenly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lady of Shalott.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However stoical the Lady may have been, the reader is too
seriously sympathetic with her inevitable discomfort&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All raimented in snowy white<br />
That loosely flew,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as she was.&nbsp; The original conclusion was distressing; we
were dropped from the airs of mysterious romance:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They crossed themselves, their stars they
blest,<br />
Knight, minstrel, abbot, squire, and guest;<br />
There lay a parchment on her breast,<br />
That puzzled more than all the rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The well-fed wits at Camelot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hitherto we have been &ldquo;puzzled,&rdquo; but as with the
sublime incoherences of a dream.&nbsp; Now we meet well-fed wits,
who say, &ldquo;Bless my stars!&rdquo; as perhaps we should also
have done in the circumstances&mdash;a dead lady arriving, in a
very cold east wind, alone in a boat, for &ldquo;her blood was
frozen slowly,&rdquo; as was natural, granting the weather and
the lady&rsquo;s airy costume.&nbsp; It is certainly matter of
surprise that the young poet&rsquo;s vision broke up in this
humorous manner.&nbsp; And, after all, it is less surprising that
the Scorpion, finding such matter in a new little book by a new
young man, was more sensitive to the absurdity than to the
romance.&nbsp; But no lover of poetry should have been blind to
the almost flawless excellence of <i>Mariana in the South</i>,
inspired by the landscape of the Proven&ccedil;al tour with
Arthur Hallam.&nbsp; In consequence of Lockhart&rsquo;s censures,
or in deference to the maturer taste of the poet, <i>The
Miller&rsquo;s Daughter</i> was greatly altered before
1842.&nbsp; It is one of the earliest, if not the very earliest,
of Tennyson&rsquo;s domestic English idylls, poems with
conspicuous beauties, but not without sacrifices to that Muse of
the home affections on whom Sir Barnes Newcome delivered his
famous lecture.&nbsp; The seventh stanza perhaps hardly deserved
to be altered, as it is, so as to bring in &ldquo;minnows&rdquo;
where &ldquo;fish&rdquo; had been the reading, and where
&ldquo;trout&rdquo; would best recall an English chalk
stream.&nbsp; To the angler the rising trout, which left the poet
cold, is at least as welcome as the &ldquo;reflex of a beauteous
form.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Every woman seems an angel at the
water-side,&rdquo; said &ldquo;that good old angler, now with
God,&rdquo; Thomas Todd Stoddart, and so &ldquo;the long and
listless boy&rdquo; found it to be.&nbsp; It is no wonder that
the mother was &ldquo;<i>slowly</i> brought to yield consent to
my desire.&rdquo;&nbsp; The domestic affections, in fact, do not
adapt themselves so well to poetry as the passion, unique in
Tennyson, of <i>Fatima</i>.&nbsp; The critics who hunt for
parallels or plagiarisms will note&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O Love, O fire! once he drew<br />
With one long kiss my whole soul thro&rsquo;<br />
My lips,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and will observe Mr Browning&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Once he kissed<br />
My soul out in a fiery mist.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to <i>&OElig;none</i>, the scenery of that earliest of the
classical idylls is borrowed from the Pyrenees and the tour with
Hallam.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is possible that the poem may have been
suggested by Beattie&rsquo;s <i>Judgment of Paris</i>,&rdquo;
says Mr Collins; it is also possible that the tale which</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quintus Calaber<br />
Somewhat lazily handled of old&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>may have reached Tennyson&rsquo;s mind from an older writer
than Beattie.&nbsp; He is at least as likely to have been
familiar with Greek myth as with the lamented
&ldquo;Minstrel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The form of 1833, greatly altered
in 1842, contained such unlucky phrases as &ldquo;cedar
shadowy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;snowycoloured,&rdquo;
&ldquo;marblecold,&rdquo; &ldquo;violet-eyed&rdquo;&mdash;easy
spoils of criticism.&nbsp; The alterations which converted a
beautiful but faulty into a beautiful and flawless poem perhaps
obscure the significance of &OElig;none&rsquo;s &ldquo;I will not
die alone,&rdquo; which in the earlier volume directly refers to
the foreseen end of all as narrated in Tennyson&rsquo;s late
piece, <i>The Death of &OElig;none</i>.&nbsp; The whole poem
brings to mind the glowing hues of Titian and the famous Homeric
lines on the divine wedlock of Zeus and Hera.</p>
<p>The allegory or moral of <i>The Palace of Art</i> does not
need explanation.&nbsp; Not many of the poems owe more to
revision.&nbsp; The early stanza about Isaiah, with fierce
Ezekiel, and &ldquo;Eastern Confutzee,&rdquo; did undeniably
remind the reader, as Lockhart said, of <i>The Groves of
Blarney</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With statues gracing that noble place
in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All haythen goddesses most rare,<br />
Petrarch, Plato, and Nebuchadnezzar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All standing naked in the open air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the early version the Soul, being too much &ldquo;up to
date,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lit white streams of dazzling
gas,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>like Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus her intense, untold delight,<br />
In deep or vivid colour, smell, and sound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was flattered day and night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lockhart was not fond of Sir Walter&rsquo;s experiments in
gas, the &ldquo;smell&rdquo; gave him no &ldquo;deep, untold
delight,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;infamous review&rdquo; was biassed
by these circumstances.</p>
<p>The volume of 1833 was in nothing more remarkable than in its
proof of the many-sidedness of the author.&nbsp; He offered
medi&aelig;val romance, and classical perfection touched with the
romantic spirit, and domestic idyll, of which <i>The May
Queen</i> is probably the most popular example.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;mysterious being,&rdquo; conversant with &ldquo;the
spiritual world,&rdquo; might have been expected to disdain
topics well within the range of Eliza Cook.&nbsp; He did not
despise but elevated them, and thereby did more to introduce
himself to the wide English public than he could have done by a
century of <i>Fatimas</i> or <i>Lotos-Eaters</i>.&nbsp; On the
other hand, a taste more fastidious, or more perverse, will
scarcely be satisfied with pathos which in process of time has
come to seem &ldquo;obvious.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pathos of early
death in the prime of beauty is less obvious in Homer, where
Achilles is to be the victim, or in the laments of the Anthology,
where we only know that the dead bride or maiden was fair; but
the poor May Queen is of her nature rather commonplace.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That good man, the clergyman, has told me
words of peace,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>strikes a note rather resembling the Tennysonian parody of
Wordsworth&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Mr Wilkinson, a clergyman.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Lotos-Eaters</i>, of course, is at the opposite pole of
the poet&rsquo;s genius.&nbsp; A few plain verses of the
<i>Odyssey</i>, almost bald in their reticence, are the <i>point
de rep&egrave;re</i> of the most magical vision expressed in the
most musical verse.&nbsp; Here is the languid charm of Spenser,
enriched with many classical memories, and pictures of natural
beauty gorgeously yet delicately painted.&nbsp; After the
excision of some verses, rather fantastical, in 1842, the poem
became a flawless masterpiece,&mdash;one of the eternal
possessions of song.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the opening of <i>The Dream of Fair
Women</i> was marred in 1833 by the grotesque introductory verses
about &ldquo;a man that sails in a balloon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Young as
Tennyson was, these freakish passages are a psychological marvel
in the work of one who did not lack the saving sense of
humour.&nbsp; The poet, wafted on the wing and &ldquo;pinion that
the Theban eagle bear,&rdquo; cannot conceivably be likened to an
aeronaut waving flags out of a balloon&mdash;except in a spirit
of self-mockery which was not Tennyson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His
remarkable self-discipline in excising the fantastic and
superfluous, and reducing his work to its classical perfection of
thought and form, is nowhere more remarkable than in this
magnificent vision.&nbsp; It is probably by mere accidental
coincidence of thought that, in the verses <i>To J. S.</i> (James
Spedding), Tennyson reproduces the noble speech on the
warrior&rsquo;s death which Sir Walter Scott places in the lips
of the great Dundee: &ldquo;It is the memory which the soldier
leaves behind him, like the long train of light that follows the
sunken sun, <i>that</i> is all that is worth caring for,&rdquo;
the light which lingers eternally on the hills of Atholl.&nbsp;
Tennyson&rsquo;s lines are a close parallel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His memory long will live alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all our hearts, as mournful light<br />
That broods above the fallen sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dwells in heaven half the night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though Tennyson disliked the exhibition of &ldquo;the chips of
the workshop,&rdquo; we have commented on them, on the early
readings of the early volumes.&nbsp; They may be regarded more
properly as the sketches of a master than as &ldquo;chips,&rdquo;
and do more than merely engage the idle curiosity of the fanatics
of first editions.&nbsp; They prove that the poet was studious of
perfection, and wisely studious, for his alterations, unlike
those of some authors, were almost invariably for the better, the
saner, the more mature in taste.&nbsp; The early readings are
also worth notice, because they partially explain, by their
occasionally fantastic and humourless character, the lack of
early and general recognition of the poet&rsquo;s genius.&nbsp;
The native prejudice of mankind is not in favour of a new
poet.&nbsp; Of new poets there are always so many, most of them
bad, that nature has protected mankind by an armour of
suspiciousness.&nbsp; The world, and Lockhart, easily found good
reasons for distrusting this new claimant of the ivy and the
bays: moreover, since about 1814 there had been a reaction
against new poetry.&nbsp; The market was glutted.&nbsp; Scott had
set everybody on reading, and too many on writing, novels.&nbsp;
The great reaction of the century against all forms of literature
except prose fiction had begun.&nbsp; Near the very date of
Tennyson&rsquo;s first volume Bulwer Lytton, as we saw, had
frankly explained that he wrote novels because nobody would look
at anything else.&nbsp; Tennyson had to overcome this universal,
or all but universal, indifference to new poetry, and, after
being silent for ten years, overcome it he did&mdash;a remarkable
victory of art and of patient courage.&nbsp; Times were even
worse for poets than to-day.&nbsp; Three hundred copies of the
new volume were sold!&nbsp; But Tennyson&rsquo;s friends were not
puffers in league with pushing publishers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the poet in 1833 went on quietly and undefeated with
his work.&nbsp; He composed <i>The Gardener&rsquo;s Daughter</i>,
and was at work on the <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>, suppressed
till the ninth year, on the Horatian plan.&nbsp; Many poems were
produced (and even written out, which a number of his pieces
never were), and were left in manuscript till they appeared in
the Biography.&nbsp; Most of these are so little worthy of the
author that the marvel is how he came to write them&mdash;in what
uninspired hours.&nbsp; Unlike Wordsworth, he could weed the
tares from his wheat.&nbsp; His studies were in Greek, German,
Italian, history (a little), and chemistry, botany, and
electricity&mdash;&ldquo;cross-grained Muses,&rdquo; these
last.</p>
<p>It was on September 15, 1833, that Arthur Hallam died.&nbsp;
Unheralded by sign or symptom of disease as it was, the news fell
like a thunderbolt from a serene sky.&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s and
Hallam&rsquo;s love had been &ldquo;passing the love of
women.&rdquo;&nbsp; A blow like this drives a man on the rocks of
the ultimate, the insoluble problems of destiny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
this the end?&rdquo;&nbsp; Nourished as on the milk of lions, on
the elevating and strengthening doctrines of popular science,
trained from childhood to forego hope and attend evening
lectures, the young critics of our generation find Tennyson a
weakling because he had hopes and fears concerning the ultimate
renewal of what was more than half his life&mdash;his
friendship.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That faith I fain would keep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That hope I&rsquo;ll not forego:<br />
Eternal be the sleep&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless to waken so,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>wrote Lockhart, and the verses echoed ceaselessly in the
widowed heart of Carlyle.&nbsp; These men, it is part of the duty
of critics later born to remember, were not children or cowards,
though they dreamed, and hoped, and feared.&nbsp; We ought to
make allowance for failings incident to an age not yet fully
enlightened by popular science, and still undivorced from
spiritual ideas that are as old as the human race, and perhaps
not likely to perish while that race exists.&nbsp; Now and then
even scientific men have been mistaken, especially when they have
declined to examine evidence, as in this problem of the
transcendental nature of the human spirit they usually do.&nbsp;
At all events Tennyson was unconvinced that death is the end, and
shortly after the fatal tidings arrived from Vienna he began to
write fragments in verse preluding to the poem of <i>In
Memoriam</i>.&nbsp; He also began, in a mood of great misery,
<i>The Two Voices</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>Thoughts of a
Suicide</i>.&nbsp; The poem seems to have been partly done by
September 1834, when Spedding commented on it, and on the
beautiful <i>Sir Galahad</i>, &ldquo;intended for something of a
male counterpart to <i>St Agnes</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>Morte
d&rsquo;Arthur</i> Tennyson then thought &ldquo;the best thing I
have managed lately.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very early in 1835 many stanzas
of <i>In Memoriam</i> had taken form.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not wish
to be dragged forward in any shape before the reading public at
present,&rdquo; wrote the poet, when he heard that Mill desired
to write on him.&nbsp; His <i>&OElig;none</i> he had brought to
its new perfection, and did not desire comments on work now
several years old.&nbsp; He also wrote his <i>Ulysses</i> and his
<i>Tithonus</i>.</p>
<p>If ever the term &ldquo;morbid&rdquo; could have been applied
to Tennyson, it would have been in the years immediately
following the death of Arthur Hallam.&nbsp; But the application
would have been unjust.&nbsp; True, the poet was living out of
the world; he was unhappy, and he was, as people say,
&ldquo;doing nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was so poor that he sold
his Chancellor&rsquo;s prize gold medal, and he did not</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Scan his whole horizon<br
/>
In quest of what he could clap eyes on,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the way of money-making, which another poet describes as
the normal attitude of all men as well as of pirates.&nbsp; A
careless observer would have thought that the poet was
dawdling.&nbsp; But he dwelt in no Castle of Indolence; he
studied, he composed, he corrected his verses: like Sir Walter in
Liddesdale, &ldquo;he was making himsel&rsquo; a&rsquo; the
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not neglect the movements of the great
world in that dawn of discontent with the philosophy of
commercialism.&nbsp; But it was not his vocation to plunge into
the fray, and on to platforms.</p>
<p>It is a very rare thing anywhere, especially in England, for a
man deliberately to choose poetry as the duty of his life, and to
remain loyal, as a consequence, to the bride of St
Francis&mdash;Poverty.&nbsp; This loyalty Tennyson maintained,
even under the temptation to make money in recognised ways
presented by his new-born love for his future wife, Miss Emily
Sellwood.&nbsp; They had first met in 1830, when she, a girl of
seventeen, seemed to him like &ldquo;a Dryad or an Oread
wandering here.&rdquo;&nbsp; But admiration became the affection
of a lifetime when Tennyson met Miss Sellwood as bridesmaid to
her sister, the bride of his brother Charles, in 1836.&nbsp; The
poet could not afford to marry, and, like the hero of <i>Locksley
Hall</i>, he may have asked himself, &ldquo;What is that which I
should do?&rdquo;&nbsp; By 1840 he had done nothing tangible and
lucrative, and correspondence between the lovers was
forbidden.&nbsp; That neither dreamed of Tennyson&rsquo;s
deserting poetry for a more normal profession proved of great
benefit to the world.&nbsp; The course is one which could only be
justified by the absolute certainty of possessing genius.</p>
<h2><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>III.<br />
1837&ndash;1842.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1837 the Tennysons left the old
rectory; till 1840 they lived at High Beech in Epping Forest, and
after a brief stay at Tunbridge Wells went to Boxley, near
Maidstone.</p>
<p>It appears that at last the poet had &ldquo;beat his music
out,&rdquo; though his friends &ldquo;still tried to cheer
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the man who wrote <i>Ulysses</i> when his
grief was fresh could not be suspected of declining into a
hypochondriac.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I mean to make my mark at all, it
must be by shortness,&rdquo; he said at this time; &ldquo;for the
men before me had been so diffuse, and most of the big things,
except <i>King Arthur</i>, had been done.&rdquo;&nbsp; The age
had not <i>la t&ecirc;te &eacute;pique</i>: Poe had announced the
paradox that there is no such thing as a long poem, and even in
dealing with Arthur, Tennyson followed the example of Theocritus
in writing, not an epic, but epic idylls.&nbsp; Long poems suit
an age of listeners, for which they were originally composed, or
of leisure and few books.&nbsp; At present epics are read for
duty&rsquo;s sake, not for the only valid reason, &ldquo;for
human pleasure,&rdquo; in FitzGerald&rsquo;s phrase.</p>
<p>Between 1838 and 1840 Tennyson made some brief tours in
England with FitzGerald, and, coming from Coventry, wrote
<i>Godiva</i>.&nbsp; His engagement with Miss Sellwood seemed to
be adjourned <i>sine die</i>, as they were forbidden to
correspond.</p>
<p>By 1841 Tennyson was living at Mablethorpe on the Lincolnshire
coast; working at his volumes of 1842, much urged by FitzGerald
and American admirers, who had heard of the poet through
Emerson.&nbsp; Moxon was to be the publisher, himself something
of a poet; but early in 1842 he had not yet received the
MS.&nbsp; Perhaps Emerson heard of Tennyson through Carlyle, who,
says Sterling, &ldquo;said more in your praise than in any
one&rsquo;s except Cromwell, and an American backwoodsman who has
killed thirty or forty people with a bowie-knife.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Carlyle at this time was much attached to Lockhart, editor of the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, and it may have been Carlyle who
converted Lockhart to admiration of his old victim.&nbsp; Carlyle
had very little more appreciation of Keats than had Byron, or (in
early days) Lockhart, and it was probably as much the man of
heroic physical mould, &ldquo;a life-guardsman spoilt by making
poetry,&rdquo; and the unaffected companion over a pipe, as the
poet, that attracted him in Tennyson.&nbsp; As we saw, when the
two triumphant volumes of 1842 did appear, Lockhart asked
Sterling to review whatever book he pleased (meaning the Poems)
in the <i>Quarterly</i>.&nbsp; The praise of Sterling may seem
lukewarm to us, especially when compared with that of Spedding in
the <i>Edinburgh</i>.&nbsp; But Sterling, and Lockhart too, were
obliged to &ldquo;gang warily.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lockhart had, to his
constant annoyance, &ldquo;a partner, Mr Croker,&rdquo; and I
have heard from the late Dean Boyle that Mr Croker was much
annoyed by even the mild applause yielded in the <i>Quarterly</i>
to the author of the <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>.</p>
<p>While preparing the volumes of 1842 at Boxley,
Tennyson&rsquo;s life was divided between London and the society
of his brother-in-law, Mr Edmund Lushington, the great Greek
scholar and Professor of Greek at Glasgow University.&nbsp; There
was in Mr Lushington&rsquo;s personal aspect, and noble
simplicity of manner and character, something that strongly
resembled Tennyson himself.&nbsp; Among their common friends were
Lord Houghton (Monckton Milnes), Mr Lear of the <i>Book of
Nonsense</i> (&ldquo;with such a pencil, such a pen&rdquo;), Mr
Venables (who at school modified the profile of Thackeray), and
Lord Kelvin.&nbsp; In town Tennyson met his friends at The Cock,
which he rendered classic; among them were Thackeray, Forster,
Maclise, and Dickens.&nbsp; The times were stirring: social
agitation, and &ldquo;Carol philosophy&rdquo; in Dickens, with
growls from Carlyle, marked the period.&nbsp; There was also a
kind of optimism in the air, a prophetic optimism, not yet
fulfilled.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fly, happy happy sails, and bear the
Press!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That mission no longer strikes us as exquisitely
felicitous.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mission of the Cross,&rdquo; and of
the missionaries, means international complications; and
&ldquo;the markets of the Golden Year&rdquo; are precisely the
most fruitful causes of wars and rumours of wars:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sea and air are dark<br
/>
With great contrivances of Power.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tennyson&rsquo;s was not an unmitigated optimism, and had no
special confidence in</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The herd, wild hearts and feeble wings<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That every sophister can lime.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His political poetry, in fact, was very unlike the socialist
chants of Mr William Morris, or <i>Songs before
Sunrise</i>.&nbsp; He had nothing to say about</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The blood on the hands of the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the lie on the lips of the Priest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hands of Presidents have not always been unstained; nor
are statements of a mythical nature confined to the lips of the
clergy.&nbsp; The poet was anxious that freedom should
&ldquo;broaden down,&rdquo; but &ldquo;slowly,&rdquo; not with
indelicate haste.&nbsp; Persons who are more in a hurry will
never care for the political poems, and it is certain that
Tennyson did not feel sympathetically inclined towards the
Iberian patriot who said that his darling desire was &ldquo;to
cut the throats of all the <i>cur&eacute;s</i>,&rdquo; like some
Covenanters of old.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mais vous connaissez mon
c&oelig;ur&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and a pretty black one it
is,&rdquo; thought young Tennyson.&nbsp; So cautious in youth,
during his Pyrenean tour with Hallam in 1830, Tennyson could not
become a convinced revolutionary later.&nbsp; We must accept him
with his limitations: nor must we confuse him with the hero of
his <i>Locksley Hall</i>, one of the most popular, and most
parodied, of the poems of 1842: full of beautiful images and
&ldquo;confusions of a wasted youth,&rdquo; a youth dramatically
conceived, and in no way autobiographical.</p>
<p>In so marvellous a treasure of precious things as the volumes
of 1842, perhaps none is more splendid, perfect, and perdurable
than the <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>.&nbsp; It had been written
seven years earlier, and pronounced by the poet &ldquo;not
bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tennyson was never, perhaps, a very deep
Arthurian student.&nbsp; A little cheap copy of Malory was his
companion. <a name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39"
class="citation">[39]</a>&nbsp; He does not appear to have gone
deeply into the French and German &ldquo;literature of the
subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; Malory&rsquo;s compilation (1485) from
French and English sources, with the <i>Mabinogion</i> of Lady
Charlotte Guest, sufficed for him as materials.&nbsp; The whole
poem, enshrined in the memory of all lovers of verse, is richly
studded, as the hilt of Excalibur, with classical memories.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A faint Homeric echo&rdquo; it is not, nor a Virgilian
echo, but the absolute voice of old romance, a thing that might
have been chanted by</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The lonely maiden of the Lake&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the
deeps,<br />
Upon the hidden bases of the hills.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most exquisite adaptation of all are the lines
from the <i>Odyssey</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where falls not hail nor rain, nor any
snow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Softly through the flutes of the Grecians&rdquo; came
first these Elysian numbers, then through Lucretius, then through
Tennyson&rsquo;s own <i>Lucretius</i>, then in Mr
Swinburne&rsquo;s <i>Atalanta in Calydon</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lands indiscoverable in the unheard-of
west<br />
Round which the strong stream of a sacred sea<br />
Rolls without wind for ever, and the snow<br />
There shows not her white wings and windy feet,<br />
Nor thunder nor swift rain saith anything,<br />
Nor the sun burns, but all things rest and thrive.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So fortunate in their transmission through poets have been the
lines of &ldquo;the Ionian father of the rest,&rdquo; the
greatest of them all.</p>
<p>In the variety of excellences which marks Tennyson, the new
English idylls of 1842 hold their prominent place.&nbsp; Nothing
can be more exquisite and more English than the picture of
&ldquo;the garden that I love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Theocritus cannot be
surpassed; but the idyll matches to the seventh of his, where it
is most closely followed, and possesses such a picture of a girl
as the Sicilian never tried to paint.</p>
<p><i>Dora</i> is another idyll, resembling the work of a
Wordsworth in a clime softer than that of the Fells.&nbsp; The
lays of Edwin Morris and Edward Bull are not among the more
enduring of even the playful poems.&nbsp; The <i>St Simeon
Stylites</i> appears &ldquo;made to the hand&rdquo; of the author
of <i>Men and Women</i> rather than of Tennyson.&nbsp; The
grotesque vanity of the anchorite is so remote from us, that we
can scarcely judge of the truth of the picture, though the East
has still her parallels to St Simeon.&nbsp; From the almost,
perhaps quite, incredible ascetic the poet lightly turns to
&ldquo;society verse&rdquo; lifted up into the air of poetry, in
the charm of <i>The Talking Oak</i>, and the happy flitting
sketches of actual history; and thence to the strength and
passion of <i>Love and Duty</i>.&nbsp; Shall</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sin
itself be found<br />
The cloudy porch oft opening on the Sun?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this is the province of sin is a pretty popular modern
moral.&nbsp; But Honour is the better part, and here was a poet
who had the courage to say so; though, to be sure, the words ring
strange in an age when highly respectable matrons assure us that
&ldquo;passion,&rdquo; like charity, covers a multitude of
sins.&nbsp; <i>Love and Duty</i>, we must admit, is &ldquo;early
Victorian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Ulysses</i> is almost a rival to the <i>Morte
d&rsquo;Arthur</i>.&nbsp; It is of an early date, after Arthur
Hallam&rsquo;s death, and Thackeray speaks of the poet chanting
his</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great Achilles whom we knew,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as if he thought that this was in Cambridge days.&nbsp; But it
is later than these.&nbsp; Tennyson said, &ldquo;<i>Ulysses</i>
was written soon after Arthur Hallam&rsquo;s death, and gave my
feeling about the need of going forward, and braving the struggle
of life, perhaps more simply than anything in <i>In
Memoriam</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Assuredly the expression is more
simple, and more noble, and the personal emotion more dignified
for the classic veil.&nbsp; When the plaintive Pessimist
(&ldquo;&lsquo;proud of the title,&rsquo; as the Living Skeleton
said when they showed him&rdquo;) tells us that &ldquo;not to
have been born is best,&rdquo; we may answer with
Ulysses&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Life piled on life<br />
Were all too little.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ulysses of Tennyson, of course, is Dante&rsquo;s Ulysses,
not Homer&rsquo;s Odysseus, who brought home to Ithaca not one of
his mariners.&nbsp; His last known adventure, the journey to the
land of men who knew not the savour of salt, Odysseus was to make
on foot and alone; so spake the ghost of Tiresias within the
poplar pale of Persephone.</p>
<p><i>The Two Voices</i> expresses the contest of doubts and
griefs with the spirit of endurance and joy which speaks alone in
<i>Ulysses</i>.&nbsp; The man who is unhappy, but does not want
to put an end to himself, has certainly the better of the
argument with the despairing Voice.&nbsp; The arguments of
&ldquo;that barren Voice&rdquo; are, indeed, remarkably deficient
in cogency and logic, if we can bring ourselves to strip the
discussion of its poetry.&nbsp; The original title, <i>Thoughts
of a Suicide</i>, was inappropriate.&nbsp; The suicidal
suggestions are promptly faced and confuted, and the mood of the
author is throughout that of one who thinks life worth
living:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whatever crazy sorrow saith,<br />
No life that breathes with human breath<br />
Has ever truly long&rsquo;d for death.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis life whereof our nerves are scant,<br />
Oh life, not death, for which we pant;<br />
More life, and fuller, that I want.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to be a satisfactory reply to the persons who eke
out a livelihood by publishing pessimistic books, and hooting, as
the great Alexandre Dumas says, at the great drama of Life.</p>
<p>With <i>The Day-Dream</i> (of The Sleeping Beauty) Tennyson
again displays his matchless range of powers.&nbsp; Verse of
Society rises into a charmed and musical fantasy, passing from
the Berlin-wool work of the period</p>
<blockquote><p>(&ldquo;Take the broidery frame, and add<br />
A crimson to the quaint Macaw&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>into the enchanted land of the fable: princes immortal,
princesses eternally young and fair.&nbsp; The <i>St Agnes</i>
and <i>Sir Galahad</i>, companion pieces, contain the romance, as
<i>St Simeon Stylites</i> shows the repulsive side of asceticism;
for the saint and the knight are young, beautiful, and eager as
St Theresa in her childhood.&nbsp; It has been said, I do not
know on what authority, that the poet had no recollection of
composing <i>Sir Galahad</i>, any more than Scott remembered
composing <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>, or Thackeray parts of
<i>Pendennis</i>.&nbsp; The haunting of Tennyson&rsquo;s mind by
the Arthurian legends prompted also the lovely fragment on the
Queen&rsquo;s last Maying, <i>Sir Launcelot and Queen
Guinevere</i>, a thing of perfect charm and music.&nbsp; The
ballads of <i>Lady Clare</i> and <i>The Lord of Burleigh</i> are
not examples of the poet in his strength; for his power and
fantasy we must turn to <i>The Vision of Sin</i>, where the early
passages have the languid voluptuous music of <i>The
Lotos-Eaters</i>, with the ethical element superadded, while the
portion beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wrinkled ostler, grim and thin!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is in parts reminiscent of Burns&rsquo;s <i>Jolly
Beggars</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Break</i>, <i>Break</i>, <i>Break</i>,
we hear a note prelusive to <i>In Memoriam</i>, much of which was
already composed.</p>
<p>The Poems of 1842 are always vocal in the memories of all
readers of English verse.&nbsp; None are more familiar, at least
to men of the generations which immediately followed
Tennyson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; FitzGerald was apt to think that the poet
never again attained the same level, and I venture to suppose
that he never rose above it.&nbsp; For FitzGerald&rsquo;s
opinion, right or wrong, it is easy to account.&nbsp; He had seen
all the pieces in manuscript; they were his cherished possession
before the world knew them.&nbsp; <i>C&rsquo;est mon homme</i>,
he might have said of Tennyson, as Boileau said of
Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; Before the public awoke FitzGerald had
&ldquo;discovered Tennyson,&rdquo; and that at the age most open
to poetry and most enthusiastic in friendship.&nbsp; Again, the
Poems of 1842 were <i>short</i>, while <i>The Princess</i>,
<i>Maud</i>, and <i>The Idylls of the King</i> were relatively
long, and, with <i>In Memoriam</i>, possessed unity of
subject.&nbsp; They lacked the rich, the unexampled variety of
topic, treatment, and theme which marks the Poems of 1842.&nbsp;
These were all reasons why FitzGerald should think that the two
slim green volumes held the poet&rsquo;s work at its highest
level.&nbsp; Perhaps he was not wrong, after all.</p>

1842&ndash;848&mdash;THE PRINCESS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Poems, and such criticisms as
those of Spedding and Sterling, gave Tennyson his place.&nbsp;
All the world of letters heard of him.&nbsp; Dean Bradley tells
us how he took Oxford by storm in the days of the
undergraduateship of Clough and Matthew Arnold.&nbsp; Probably
both of these young writers did not share the undergraduate
enthusiasm.&nbsp; Mr Arnold, we know, did not reckon Tennyson
<i>un esprit puissant</i>.&nbsp; Like Wordsworth (who thought
Tennyson &ldquo;decidedly the first of our living poets, . . . he
has expressed in the strongest terms his gratitude to my
writings&rdquo;), Arnold was no fervent admirer of his
contemporaries.&nbsp; Besides, if Tennyson&rsquo;s work is
&ldquo;a criticism of Life,&rdquo; the moral criticism, so far,
was hidden in flowers, like the sword of Aristogiton at the
feast.&nbsp; But, on the whole, Tennyson had won the young men
who cared for poetry, though Sir Robert Peel had never heard of
him: and to win the young, as Theocritus desired to do, is more
than half the battle.&nbsp; On September 8, 1842, the poet was
able to tell Mr Lushington that &ldquo;500 of my books are sold;
according to Moxon&rsquo;s brother, I have made a
sensation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sales were not like those of
<i>Childe Harold</i> or <i>Marmion</i>; but for some twenty years
new poetry had not sold at all.&nbsp; Novels had come in about
1814, and few wanted or bought recent verse.&nbsp; But Carlyle
was converted.&nbsp; He spoke no more of a spoiled
guardsman.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you knew what my relation has been to
the thing called &lsquo;English Poetry&rsquo; for many years
back, you would think such a fact&rdquo; (his pleasure in the
book) &ldquo;surprising.&rdquo;&nbsp; Carlyle had been living (as
Mrs Carlyle too well knew) in Oliver Cromwell, a hero who
probably took no delight in <i>Lycidas</i> or <i>Comus</i>, in
Lovelace or Carew.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would give all my poetry to
have made one song like that,&rdquo; said Tennyson of
Lovelace&rsquo;s <i>Althea</i>.&nbsp; But Noll would have
disregarded them all alike, and Carlyle was full of the spirit of
the Protector.&nbsp; To conquer him was indeed a victory for
Tennyson; while Dickens, not a reading man, expressed his
&ldquo;earnest and sincere homage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tennyson was not successful in the modern way.&nbsp;
Nobody &ldquo;interviewed&rdquo; him.&nbsp; His photograph, of
course, with disquisitions on his pipes and slippers, did not
adorn the literary press.&nbsp; His literary income was not
magnified by penny-a-liners.&nbsp; He did not become a lion; he
never would roar and shake his mane in drawing-rooms.&nbsp;
Lockhart held that Society was the most agreeable form of the
stage: the dresses and actresses incomparably the
prettiest.&nbsp; But Tennyson liked Society no better than did
General Gordon.&nbsp; He had friends enough, and no desire for
new acquaintances.&nbsp; Indeed, his fortune was shattered at
this time by a strange investment in wood-carving by
machinery.&nbsp; Ruskin had only just begun to write, and
wood-carving by machinery was still deemed an enterprise at once
philanthropic and &aelig;sthetic.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s
worldly goods were all gone,&rdquo; says Lord Tennyson.&nbsp; The
poet&rsquo;s health suffered extremely: he tried a fashionable
&ldquo;cure&rdquo; at Cheltenham, where he saw miracles of
healing, but underwent none.&nbsp; In September 1845 Peel was
moved by Lord Houghton to recommend the poet for a pension
(&pound;200 annually).&nbsp; &ldquo;I have done nothing slavish
to get it: I never even solicited for it either by myself or
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like Dr Johnson, he honourably accepted what
was offered in honour.&nbsp; For some reason many persons who
write in the press are always maddened when such good fortune,
however small, however well merited, falls to a brother in
letters.&nbsp; They, of course, were &ldquo;causelessly
bitter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let them rave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If few of the rewards of literary success arrived, the
penalties at once began, and only ceased with the poet&rsquo;s
existence.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you only knew what a nuisance these
volumes of verse are!&nbsp; Rascals send me theirs per post from
America, and I have more than once been knocked up out of bed to
pay three or four shillings for books of which I can&rsquo;t get
through one page, for of all books the most insipid reading is
second-rate verse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would that versifiers took the warning!&nbsp; Tennyson had not
sent his little firstlings to Coleridge and Wordsworth: they are
only the hopeless rhymers who bombard men of letters with their
lyrics and tragedies.</p>
<p>Mr Browning was a sufferer.&nbsp; To one young twitterer he
replied in the usual way.&nbsp; The bard wrote acknowledging the
letter, but asking for a definite criticism.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do
not think myself a Shakespeare or a Milton, but I <i>know</i> I
am better than Mr Coventry Patmore or Mr Austin
Dobson.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Browning tried to procrastinate: he was
already deeply engaged with earlier arrivals of volumes of
song.&nbsp; The poet was hurt, not angry; he had expected other
things from Mr Browning: <i>he</i> ought to know his duty to
youth.&nbsp; At the intercession of a relation Mr Browning now
did his best, and the minstrel, satisfied at last, repeated his
conviction of his superiority to the authors of <i>The Angel in
the House</i> and <i>Beau Brocade</i>.&nbsp; Probably no man, not
even Mr Gladstone, ever suffered so much from minstrels as
Tennyson.&nbsp; He did not suffer them gladly.</p>
<p>In 1846 the Poems reached their fourth edition.&nbsp; Sir
Edward Bulwer Lytton (bitten by what fly who knows?) attacked
Tennyson in <i>The New Timon</i>, a forgotten satire.&nbsp; We do
not understand the ways of that generation.&nbsp; The cheap and
spiteful <i>genre</i> of satire, its forged morality, its sham
indignation, its appeal to the ape-like passions, has gone
out.&nbsp; Lytton had suffered many things (not in verse) from
Jeames Yellowplush: I do not know that he hit back at Thackeray,
but he &ldquo;passed it on&rdquo; to Thackeray&rsquo;s old
college companion.&nbsp; Tennyson, for once, replied (in
<i>Punch</i>: the verses were sent thither by John Forster); the
answer was one of magnificent contempt.&nbsp; But he soon decided
that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The noblest answer unto such<br />
Is perfect stillness when they brawl.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long afterwards the poet dedicated a work to the son of Lord
Lytton.&nbsp; He replied to no more satirists. <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a>&nbsp; Our difficulty, of course, is to
conceive such an attack coming from a man of Lytton&rsquo;s
position and genius.&nbsp; He was no hungry hack, and could, and
did, do infinitely better things than &ldquo;stand in a false
following&rdquo; of Pope.&nbsp; Probably Lytton had a false idea
that Tennyson was a rich man, a branch of his family being
affluent, and so resented the little pension.&nbsp; The poet was
so far from rich in 1846, and even after the publication of
<i>The Princess</i>, that his marriage had still to be deferred
for four years.</p>
<p>On reading <i>The Princess</i> afresh one is impressed,
despite old familiarity, with the extraordinary influence of its
beauty.&nbsp; Here are, indeed, the best words best placed, and
that curious felicity of style which makes every line a marvel,
and an eternal possession.&nbsp; It is as if Tennyson had taken
the advice which Keats gave to Shelley, &ldquo;Load every rift
with ore.&rdquo;&nbsp; To choose but one or two examples, how the
purest and freshest impression of nature is re-created in mind
and memory by the picture of Melissa with</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All her thoughts as fair
within her eyes,<br />
As bottom agates seen to wave and float<br />
In crystal currents of clear morning seas.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lyric, &ldquo;Tears, idle tears,&rdquo; is far beyond
praise: once read it seems like a thing that has always existed
in the world of poetic archetypes, and has now been not so much
composed as discovered and revealed.&nbsp; The many pictures and
similitudes in <i>The Princess</i> have a magical
gorgeousness:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;From
the illumined hall<br />
Long lanes of splendour slanted o&rsquo;er a press<br />
Of snowy shoulders, thick as herded ewes,<br />
And rainbow robes, and gems and gem-like eyes,<br />
And gold and golden heads; they to and fro<br />
Fluctuated, as flowers in storm, some red, some pale.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;small sweet Idyll&rdquo; from</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A volume of the poets of her
land&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>pure Theocritus.&nbsp; It has been admirably rendered into
Greek by Mr Gilbert Murray.&nbsp; The exquisite beauties of style
are not less exquisitely blended in the confusions of a dream,
for a dream is the thing most akin to <i>The Princess</i>.&nbsp;
Time does not exist in the realm of Gama, or in the ideal
university of Ida.&nbsp; We have a bookless North, severed but by
a frontier pillar from a golden and learned South.&nbsp; The
arts, from architecture to miniature-painting, are in their
highest perfection, while knights still tourney in armour, and
the quarrel of two nations is decided as in the gentle and joyous
passage of arms at Ashby de la Zouche.&nbsp; Such confusions are
purposefully dream-like: the vision being a composite thing, as
dreams are, haunted by the modern scene of the holiday in the
park, the &ldquo;gallant glorious chronicle,&rdquo; the Abbey,
and that &ldquo;old crusading knight austere,&rdquo; Sir
Ralph.&nbsp; The seven narrators of the scheme are like the
&ldquo;split personalities&rdquo; of dreams, and the whole scheme
is of great technical skill.&nbsp; The earlier editions lacked
the beautiful songs of the ladies, and that additional trait of
dream, the strange trance-like seizures of the Prince:
&ldquo;fallings from us, vanishings,&rdquo; in Wordsworthian
phrase; instances of &ldquo;dissociation,&rdquo; in modern
psychological terminology.&nbsp; Tennyson himself, like Shelley
and Wordsworth, had experience of this kind of dreaming awake
which he attributes to his Prince, to strengthen the shadowy yet
brilliant character of his romance.&nbsp; It is a thing of normal
and natural <i>points de rep&egrave;re</i>; of daylight
suggestion, touched as with the magnifying and intensifying
elements of haschish-begotten phantasmagoria.&nbsp; In the same
way opium raised into the region of brilliant vision that passage
of Purchas which Coleridge was reading before he dreamed <i>Kubla
Khan</i>.&nbsp; But in Tennyson the effects were deliberately
sought and secured.</p>
<p>One might conjecture, though Lord Tennyson says nothing on the
subject, that among the suggestions for <i>The Princess</i> was
the opening of <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>.&nbsp;
Here the King of Navarre devises the College of Recluses, which
is broken up by the arrival of the Princess of France, Rosaline,
and the other ladies:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>King</i>.&nbsp; Our Court shall be a little
Academe,<br />
Still and contemplative in living art.<br />
You three, Biron, Domain, and Longaville,<br />
Have sworn for three years&rsquo; term to live with me,<br />
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><i>Biron</i>.&nbsp; That is, to live and study here three
years.<br />
But there are other strict observances;<br />
As, not to see a woman in that term.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>[<i>Reads</i>]&nbsp; &lsquo;That no woman shalt come within a
mile of my Court:&rsquo; Hath this been proclaimed?</p>
<p><i>Long</i>.&nbsp; Four days ago.</p>
<p><i>Biron</i>.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see the penalty.&nbsp;
[<i>Reads</i>]&nbsp; &lsquo;On pain of losing her
tongue.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Princess then arrives with her ladies, as the Prince does
with Cyril and Florian, as Charles did, with Buckingham, in
Spain.&nbsp; The conclusion of Shakespeare is Tennyson&rsquo;s
conclusion&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We cannot cross the cause why we are
born.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The later poet reverses the attitude of the sexes in
<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>: it is the women who make
and break the vow; and the women in <i>The Princess</i> insist on
the &ldquo;grand, epic, homicidal&rdquo; scenes, while the men
are debarred, more or less, from a sportive treatment of the
subject.&nbsp; The tavern catch of Cyril; the laughable pursuit
of the Prince by the feminine Proctors; the draggled appearance
of the adventurers in female garb, are concessions to the humour
of the situation.&nbsp; Shakespeare would certainly have given us
the song of Cyril at the picnic, and comic enough the effect
would have been on the stage.&nbsp; It may be a gross employment,
but <i>The Princess</i>, with the pretty chorus of girl
undergraduates,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In colours gayer than the morning
mist,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>went reasonably well in opera.&nbsp; Merely considered as a
romantic fiction, <i>The Princess</i> presents higher proofs of
original narrative genius than any other such attempt by its
author.</p>
<p>The poem is far from being deficient in that human interest
which Shelley said that it was as vain to ask from <i>him</i>, as
to seek to buy a leg of mutton at a gin-shop.&nbsp; The
characters, the protagonists, with Cyril, Melissa, Lady Blanche,
the child Aglaia, King Gama, the other king, Arac, and the
hero&rsquo;s mother&mdash;beautifully studied from the mother of
the poet&mdash;are all sufficiently human.&nbsp; But they seem to
waver in the magic air, &ldquo;as all the golden autumn woodland
reels&rdquo; athwart the fires of autumn leaves.&nbsp; For these
reasons, and because of the designed fantasy of the whole
composition, <i>The Princess</i> is essentially a poem for the
true lovers of poetry, of Spenser and of Coleridge.&nbsp; The
serious motive, the question of Woman, her wrongs, her rights,
her education, her capabilities, was not &ldquo;in the air&rdquo;
in 1847.&nbsp; To be sure it had often been &ldquo;in the
air.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Alexandrian Platonists, the Renaissance,
even the age of Anne, had their emancipated and learned
ladies.&nbsp; Early Greece had Sappho, Corinna, and Erinna, the
first the chief of lyric poets, even in her fragments, the two
others applauded by all Hellas.&nbsp; The French Revolution had
begotten Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and her <i>Vindication of the
Rights of Women</i>, and in France George Sand was prominent and
emancipated enough while the poet wrote.&nbsp; But, the question
of love apart, George Sand was &ldquo;very, very woman,&rdquo;
shining as a domestic character and fond of needlework.&nbsp;
England was not excited about the question which has since
produced so many disputants, inevitably shrill, and has not been
greatly meddled with by women of genius, George Eliot or Mrs
Oliphant.&nbsp; The poem, in the public indifference as to
feminine education, came rather prematurely.&nbsp; We have now
ladies&rsquo; colleges, not in haunts remote from man, but by the
sedged banks of Cam and Cherwell.&nbsp; There have been no
revolutionary results: no boys have spied these chaste nests,
with echoing romantic consequences.&nbsp; The beauty and
splendour of the Princess&rsquo;s university have not arisen in
light and colour, and it is only at St Andrews that girls wear
the academic and becoming costume of the scarlet gown.&nbsp; The
real is far below the ideal, but the real in 1847 seemed
eminently remote, or even impossible.</p>
<p>The learned Princess herself was not on our level as to
knowledge and the past of womankind.&nbsp; She knew not of their
masterly position in the law of ancient Egypt.&nbsp;
Gyn&aelig;ocracy and matriarchy, the woman the head of the savage
or prehistoric group, were things hidden from her.&nbsp; She
&ldquo;glanced at the Lycian custom,&rdquo; but not at the
Pictish, a custom which would have suited George Sand to a
marvel.&nbsp; She maligned the Hottentots.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The highest is the measure of the man,<br
/>
And not the Kaffir, Hottentot, Malay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hottentots had long ago anticipated the Princess and her
shrill modern sisterhood.&nbsp; If we take the Greeks, or even
ourselves, we may say, with Dampier (1689), &ldquo;The Hodmadods,
though a nasty people, yet are gentlemen to these&rdquo; as
regards the position of women.&nbsp; Let us hear Mr Hartland:
&ldquo;In every Hottentot&rsquo;s house the wife is
supreme.&nbsp; Her husband, poor fellow, though he may wield wide
power and influence out of doors, at home dare not even take a
mouthful of sour-milk out of the household vat without her
permission . . . The highest oath a man can take is to swear by
his eldest sister, and if he abuses this name he forfeits to her
his finest goods and sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, in 1847 England had not yet thought of imitating the
Hodmadods.&nbsp; Consequently, and by reason of the purely
literary and elaborately fantastical character of <i>The
Princess</i>, it was not of a nature to increase the poet&rsquo;s
fame and success.&nbsp; &ldquo;My book is out, and I hate it, and
so no doubt will you,&rdquo; Tennyson wrote to FitzGerald, who
hated it and said so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Like Carlyle, I gave up all
hopes of him after <i>The Princess</i>,&rdquo; indeed it was not
apt to conciliate Carlyle.&nbsp; &ldquo;None of the songs had the
old champagne flavour,&rdquo; said Fitz; and Lord Tennyson adds,
&ldquo;Nothing either by Thackeray or by my father met
FitzGerald&rsquo;s approbation unless he had first seen it in
manuscript.&rdquo;&nbsp; This prejudice was very human.&nbsp;
Lord Tennyson remarks, as to the poet&rsquo;s meaning in this
work, born too early, that &ldquo;the sooner woman finds out,
before the great educational movement begins, that &lsquo;woman
is not undeveloped man, but diverse,&rsquo; the better it will be
for the progress of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But probably the &ldquo;educational movement&rdquo; will not
make much difference to womankind on the whole.&nbsp; The old
Platonic remark that woman &ldquo;does the same things as man,
but not so well,&rdquo; will eternally hold good, at least in the
arts, and in letters, except in rare cases of genius.&nbsp; A new
Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, the most signal example of absolute genius in
history, will not come again; and the ages have waited vainly for
a new Sappho or a new Jane Austen.&nbsp; Literature, poetry,
painting, have always been fields open to woman.&nbsp; But two
names exhaust the roll of women of the highest rank in
letters&mdash;Sappho and Jane Austen.&nbsp; And &ldquo;when did
woman ever yet invent?&rdquo;&nbsp; In &ldquo;arts of
government&rdquo; Elizabeth had courage, and just saving sense
enough to yield to Cecil at the eleventh hour, and escape the
fate of &ldquo;her sister and her foe,&rdquo; the beautiful
unhappy queen who told her ladies that she dared to look on
whatever men dared to do, and herself would do it if her strength
so served her.&rdquo; <a name="citation58"></a><a
href="#footnote58" class="citation">[58]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The
foundress of the Babylonian walls&rdquo; is a myth; &ldquo;the
Rhodope that built the Pyramid&rdquo; is not a creditable myth;
for exceptions to Knox&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monstrous Regiment of
Women&rdquo; we must fall back on &ldquo;The Palmyrene that
fought Aurelian,&rdquo; and the revered name of the greatest of
English queens, Victoria.&nbsp; Thus history does not encourage
the hope that a man-like education will raise many women to the
level of the highest of their sex in the past, or even that the
enormous majority of women will take advantage of the opportunity
of a man-like education.&nbsp; A glance at the numerous
periodicals designed for the reading of women depresses optimism,
and the Princess&rsquo;s prophecy of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Two plummets dropped for one to sound the
abyss<br />
Of science, and the secrets of the mind,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is not near fulfilment.&nbsp; Fortunately the sex does not
&ldquo;love the Metaphysics,&rdquo; and perhaps has not yet
produced even a manual of Logic.&nbsp; It must suffice man and
woman to</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Walk this world<br />
Yoked in all exercise of noble end,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of a more practical character, while woman is at liberty</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;To live and learn and
be<br />
All that not harms distinctive womanhood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the conclusion of the poet who had the most
chivalrous reverence for womanhood.&nbsp; This is the
<i>eirenicon</i> of that old strife between the women and the
men&mdash;that war in which both armies are captured.&nbsp; It
may not be acceptable to excited lady combatants, who think man
their foe, when the real enemy is (what Porson damned) the Nature
of Things.</p>
<p>A new poem like <i>The Princess</i> would soon reach the
public of our day, so greatly increased are the uses of
advertisement.&nbsp; But <i>The Princess</i> moved slowly from
edition to revised and improved edition, bringing neither money
nor much increase of fame.&nbsp; The poet was living with his
family at Cheltenham, where among his new acquaintances were
Sydney Dobell, the poet of a few exquisite pieces, and F. W.
Robertson, later so popular as a preacher at Brighton.&nbsp;
Meeting him for the first time, and knowing Robertson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;wish to pluck the heart from my mystery, from pure
nervousness I would only talk of beer.&rdquo;&nbsp; This kind of
shyness beset Tennyson.&nbsp; A lady tells me that as a girl (and
a very beautiful girl) she and her sister, and a third, <i>nec
diversa</i>, met the poet, and expected high discourse.&nbsp; But
his speech was all of that wingless insect which &ldquo;gets
there, all the same,&rdquo; according to an American lyrist; the
insect which fills Mrs Carlyle&rsquo;s letters with bulletins of
her success or failure in domestic campaigns.</p>
<p>Tennyson kept visiting London, where he saw Thackeray and the
despair of Carlyle, and at Bath House he was too modest to be
introduced to the great Duke whose requiem he was to sing so
nobly.&nbsp; Oddly enough Douglas Jerrold enthusiastically
assured Tennyson, at a dinner of a Society of Authors, that
&ldquo;you are the one who will live.&rdquo;&nbsp; To that end,
humanly speaking, he placed himself under the celebrated Dr Gully
and his &ldquo;water-cure,&rdquo; a foible of that period.&nbsp;
In 1848 he made a tour to King Arthur&rsquo;s Cornish bounds, and
another to Scotland, where the Pass of Brander disappointed him:
perhaps he saw it on a fine day, and, like Glencoe, it needs
tempest and mist lit up by the white fires of many
waterfalls.&nbsp; By bonny Doon he &ldquo;fell into a passion of
tears,&rdquo; for he had all of Keats&rsquo;s sentiment for
Burns: &ldquo;There never was immortal poet if he be not
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of all English poets, the warmest in the praise
of Burns have been the two most unlike himself&mdash;Tennyson and
Keats.&nbsp; It was the songs that Tennyson preferred; Wordsworth
liked the <i>Cottar&rsquo;s Saturday Night</i>.</p>

IN MEMORIAM.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> May 1850 a few, copies of <i>In
Memoriam</i> were printed for friends, and presently the poem was
published without author&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; The pieces had been
composed at intervals, from 1833 onwards.&nbsp; It is to be
observed that the &ldquo;section about evolution&rdquo; was
written some years before 1844, when the ingenious hypotheses of
Robert Chambers, in <i>Vestiges of Creation</i>, were given to
the world, and caused a good deal of talk.&nbsp; Ten years,
again, after <i>In Memoriam</i>, came Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Origin of
Species</i>.&nbsp; These dates are worth observing.&nbsp; The
theory of evolution, of course in a rude mythical shape, is at
least as old as the theory of creation, and is found among the
speculations of the most backward savages.&nbsp; The Arunta of
Central Australia, a race remote from the polite, have a
hypothesis of evolution which postulates only a few rudimentary
forms of life, a marine environment, and the minimum of
supernormal assistance in the way of stimulating the primal forms
in the direction of more highly differentiated
developments.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rudimentary forms,
<i>Inapertwa</i>, were in reality stages in the transformation of
various plants and animals into human beings. . . .&nbsp; They
had no distinct limbs or organs of sight, hearing, or
smell.&rdquo;&nbsp; They existed in a kind of lumps, and were set
free from the cauls which enveloped them by two beings called
Ungambikula, &ldquo;a word which means &lsquo;out of
nothing,&rsquo; or &lsquo;self-existing.&rsquo;&nbsp; Men descend
from lower animals thus evolved.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a></p>
<p>This example of the doctrine of evolution in an early shape is
only mentioned to prove that the idea has been familiar to the
human mind from the lowest known stage of culture.&nbsp; Not less
familiar has been the theory of creation by a kind of supreme
being.&nbsp; The notion of creation, however, up to 1860, held
the foremost place in modern European belief.&nbsp; But Lamarck,
the elder Darwin, Monboddo, and others had submitted hypotheses
of evolution.&nbsp; Now it was part of the originality of
Tennyson, as a philosophic poet, that he had brooded from boyhood
on these early theories of evolution, in an age when they were
practically unknown to the literary, and were not patronised by
the scientific, world.&nbsp; In November 1844 he wrote to Mr
Moxon, &ldquo;I want you to get me a book which I see advertised
in the <i>Examiner</i>: it seems to contain many speculations
with which I have been familiar for years, and on which I have
written more than one poem.&rdquo;&nbsp; This book was
<i>Vestiges of Creation</i>.&nbsp; These poems are the stanzas in
<i>In Memoriam</i> about &ldquo;the greater ape,&rdquo; and about
Nature as careless of the type: &ldquo;all shall go.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The poetic and philosophic originality of Tennyson thus faced the
popular inferences as to the effect of the doctrine of evolution
upon religious beliefs long before the world was moved in all its
deeps by Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Origin of Species</i>.&nbsp; Thus the
geological record is inconsistent, we learned, with the record of
the first chapters of Genesis.&nbsp; If man is a differentiated
monkey, and if a monkey has no soul, or future life (which is
taken for granted), where are man&rsquo;s title-deeds to these
possessions?&nbsp; With other difficulties of an obvious kind,
these presented themselves to the poet with renewed force when
his only chance of happiness depended on being able to believe in
a future life, and reunion with the beloved dead.&nbsp; Unbelief
had always existed.&nbsp; We hear of atheists in the <i>Rig
Veda</i>.&nbsp; In the early eighteenth century, in the age of
Swift&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Men proved, as sure as God&rsquo;s in
Gloucester,<br />
That Moses was a great impostor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>distrust of Moses increased with the increase of hypotheses of
evolution.&nbsp; But what English poet, before Tennyson, ever
attempted &ldquo;to lay the spectres of the mind&rdquo;; ever
faced world-old problems in their most recent aspects?&nbsp; I am
not acquainted with any poet who attempted this task, and,
whatever we may think of Tennyson&rsquo;s success, I do not see
how we can deny his originality.</p>
<p>Mr Frederic Harrison, however, thinks that neither &ldquo;the
theology nor the philosophy of <i>In Memoriam</i> are new,
original, with an independent force and depth of their
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They are exquisitely graceful
re-statements of the theology of the Broad Churchman of the
school of F. D. Maurice and Jowett&mdash;a combination of
Maurice&rsquo;s somewhat illogical piety with Jowett&rsquo;s
philosophy of mystification.&rdquo;&nbsp; The piety of Maurice
may be as illogical as that of Positivism is logical, and the
philosophy of the Master of Balliol may be whatever Mr Harrison
pleases to call it.&nbsp; But as Jowett&rsquo;s earliest work
(except an essay on Etruscan religion) is of 1855, one does not
see how it could influence Tennyson before 1844.&nbsp; And what
had the Duke of Argyll written on these themes some years before
1844?&nbsp; The late Duke, to whom Mr Harrison refers in this
connection, was born in 1823.&nbsp; His philosophic ideas, if
they were to influence Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>In Memoriam</i>, must
have been set forth by him at the tender age of seventeen, or
thereabouts.&nbsp; Mr Harrison&rsquo;s sentence is, &ldquo;But
does <i>In Memoriam</i> teach anything, or transfigure any idea
which was not about that time&rdquo; (the time of writing was
mainly 1833&ndash;1840) &ldquo;common form with F. D. Maurice,
with Jowett, C. Kingsley, F. Robertson, Stopford Brooke, Mr
Ruskin, and the Duke of Argyll, Bishops Westcott and Boyd
Carpenter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dates answer Mr Harrison.&nbsp; Jowett did not publish
anything till at least fifteen years after Tennyson wrote his
poems on evolution and belief.&nbsp; Dr Boyd Carpenter&rsquo;s
works previous to 1840 are unknown to bibliography.&nbsp; F. W.
Robertson was a young parson at Cheltenham.&nbsp; Ruskin had not
published the first volume of <i>Modern Painters</i>.&nbsp; His
Oxford prize poem is of 1839.&nbsp; Mr Stopford Brooke was at
school.&nbsp; The Duke of Argyll was being privately educated:
and so with the rest, except the contemporary Maurice.&nbsp; How
can Mr Harrison say that, in the time of <i>In Memoriam</i>,
Tennyson was &ldquo;in touch with the ideas of Herschel, Owen,
Huxley, Darwin, and Tyndall&rdquo;? <a name="citation65"></a><a
href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a>&nbsp; When Tennyson
wrote the parts of <i>In Memoriam</i> which deal with science,
nobody beyond their families and friends had heard of Huxley,
Darwin, and Tyndall.&nbsp; They had not developed, much less had
they published, their &ldquo;general ideas.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even in
his journal of the <i>Cruise of the Beagle</i> Darwin&rsquo;s
ideas were religious, and he na&iuml;vely admired the works of
God.&nbsp; It is strange that Mr Harrison has based his
criticism, and his theory of Tennyson&rsquo;s want of
originality, on what seems to be a historical error.&nbsp; He
cites parts of <i>In Memoriam</i>, and remarks, &ldquo;No one can
deny that all this is exquisitely beautiful; that these eternal
problems have never been clad in such inimitable grace . . . But
the train of thought is essentially that with which ordinary
English readers have been made familiar by F. D. Maurice,
Professor Jowett, <i>Ecce Homo</i>, <i>Hypatia</i>, and now by
Arthur Balfour, Mr Drummond, and many valiant companies of
<i>Septem</i> [why <i>Septem</i>?] <i>contra
Diabolum</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One must keep repeating the historical
verity that the ideas of <i>In Memoriam</i> could not have been
&ldquo;made familiar by&rdquo; authors who had not yet published
anything, or by books yet undreamed of and unborn, such as
<i>Ecce Homo</i> and Jowett&rsquo;s work on some of St
Paul&rsquo;s Epistles.&nbsp; If these books contain the ideas of
<i>In Memoriam</i>, it is by dint of repetition and borrowing
from <i>In Memoriam</i>, or by coincidence.&nbsp; The originality
was Tennyson&rsquo;s, for we cannot dispute the evidence of
dates.</p>
<p>When one speaks of &ldquo;originality&rdquo; one does not mean
that Tennyson discovered the existence of the ultimate
problems.&nbsp; But at Cambridge (1828&ndash;1830) he had voted
&ldquo;No&rdquo; in answer to the question discussed by
&ldquo;the Apostles,&rdquo; &ldquo;Is an intelligible
[intelligent?] First Cause deducible from the phenomena of the
universe?&rdquo; <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a>&nbsp; He had also propounded the theory
that &ldquo;the development of the human body might possibly be
traced from the radiated vermicular molluscous and vertebrate
organisms,&rdquo; thirty years before Darwin published <i>The
Origin of Species</i>.&nbsp; To be concerned so early with such
hypotheses, and to face, in poetry, the religious or irreligious
inferences which may be drawn from them, decidedly constitutes
part of the poetic originality of Tennyson.&nbsp; His attitude,
as a poet, towards religious doubt is only so far not original,
as it is part of the general reaction from the freethinking of
the eighteenth century.&nbsp; Men had then been freethinkers
<i>avec d&eacute;lices</i>.&nbsp; It was a joyous thing to be an
atheist, or something very like one; at all events, it was
glorious to be &ldquo;emancipated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many still find
it glorious, as we read in the tone of Mr Huxley, when he
triumphs and tramples over pious dukes and bishops.&nbsp; Shelley
said that a certain schoolgirl &ldquo;would make a dear little
atheist.&rdquo;&nbsp; But by 1828&ndash;1830 men were less joyous
in their escape from all that had hitherto consoled and fortified
humanity.&nbsp; Long before he dreamed of <i>In Memoriam</i>, in
the <i>Poems chiefly Lyrical</i> of 1830 Tennyson had
written&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; said I, in my morn of
youth,<br />
The unsunn&rsquo;d freshness of my strength,<br />
When I went forth in quest of truth,<br />
&lsquo;It is man&rsquo;s privilege to doubt.&rsquo; . . .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay me!&nbsp; I fear<br />
All may not doubt, but everywhere<br />
Some must clasp Idols.&nbsp; Yet, my God,<br />
Whom call I Idol?&nbsp; Let Thy dove<br />
Shadow me over, and my sins<br />
Be unremember&rsquo;d, and Thy love<br />
Enlighten me.&nbsp; Oh teach me yet<br />
Somewhat before the heavy clod<br />
Weighs on me, and the busy fret<br />
Of that sharp-headed worm begins<br />
In the gross blackness underneath.</p>
<p>Oh weary life! oh weary death!<br />
Oh spirit and heart made desolate!<br />
Oh damn&egrave;d vacillating state!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the philosophy of <i>In Memoriam</i> may be, indeed is,
regarded by robust, first-rate, and far from sensitive minds, as
a &ldquo;damn&egrave;d vacillating state.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poet
is not so imbued with the spirit of popular science as to be sure
that he knows everything: knows that there is nothing but atoms
and ether, with no room for God or a soul.&nbsp; He is far from
that happy cock-certainty, and consequently is exposed to the
contempt of the cock-certain.&nbsp; The poem, says Mr Harrison,
&ldquo;has made Tennyson the idol of the Anglican
clergyman&mdash;the world in which he was born and the world in
which his life was ideally passed&mdash;the idol of all cultured
youth and of all &aelig;sthetic women.&nbsp; It is an honourable
post to fill&rdquo;&mdash;that of idol.&nbsp; &ldquo;The argument
of <i>In Memoriam</i> apparently is . . . that we should faintly
trust the larger hope.&rdquo;&nbsp; That, I think, is not the
argument, not the conclusion of the poem, but is a casual
expression of one mood among many moods.</p>
<p>The argument and conclusion of <i>In Memoriam</i> are the
argument and conclusion of the life of Tennyson, and of the love
of Tennyson, that immortal passion which was a part of himself,
and which, if aught of us endure, is living yet, and must live
eternally.&nbsp; From the record of his Life by his son we know
that his trust in &ldquo;the larger hope&rdquo; was not
&ldquo;faint,&rdquo; but strengthened with the years.&nbsp; There
are said to have been less hopeful intervals.</p>
<p>His faith is, of course, no argument for others,&mdash;at
least it ought not to be.&nbsp; We are all the creatures of our
bias, our environment, our experience, our emotions.&nbsp; The
experience of Tennyson was unlike the experience of most
men.&nbsp; It yielded him subjective grounds for belief.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;opened a path unto many,&rdquo; like Yama, the Vedic being
who discovered the way to death.&nbsp; But Tennyson&rsquo;s path
led not to death, but to life spiritual, and to hope, and he did
&ldquo;give a new impulse to the thought of his age,&rdquo; as
other great poets have done.&nbsp; Of course it may be an impulse
to wrong thought.&nbsp; As the philosophical Australian black
said, &ldquo;We shall know when we are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Harrison argues as if, unlike Tennyson, Byron, Wordsworth,
Shelley, and Burns produced &ldquo;original ideas fresh from
their own spirit, and not derived from contemporary
thinkers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not know what original ideas these
great poets discovered and promulgated; their ideas seem to have
been &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo;&nbsp; These poets &ldquo;made them
current coin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shelley thought that he owed many of
his ideas to Godwin, a contemporary thinker.&nbsp; Wordsworth has
a debt to Plato, a thinker not contemporary.&nbsp; Burns&rsquo;s
democratic independence was &ldquo;in the air,&rdquo; and had
been, in Scotland, since Elder remarked on it in a letter to
Ingles in 1515.&nbsp; It is not the ideas, it is the expression
of the ideas, that marks the poet.&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s ideas
are relatively novel, though as old as Plotinus, for they are
applied to a novel, or at least an unfamiliar, mental
situation.&nbsp; Doubt was abroad, as it always is; but, for
perhaps the first time since Porphyry wrote his letter to
Abammon, the doubters desired to believe, and said, &ldquo;Lord,
help Thou my unbelief.&rdquo;&nbsp; To robust, not sensitive
minds, very much in unity with themselves, the attitude seems
contemptible, or at best decently futile.&nbsp; Yet I cannot
think it below the dignity of mankind, conscious that it is not
omniscient.&nbsp; The poet does fail in logic (<i>In
Memoriam</i>, cxx.) when he says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let him, the wiser man who springs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hereafter, up from childhood shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His action like the greater ape,<br />
But I was <i>born</i> to other things.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not well acquainted with the habits of the greater ape,
but it would probably be unwise, and perhaps indecent, to imitate
him, even if &ldquo;we also are his offspring.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
might as well revert to polyandry and paint, because our Celtic
or Pictish ancestors, if we had any, practised the one and wore
the other.&nbsp; However, petulances like the verse on the
greater ape are rare in <i>In Memoriam</i>.&nbsp; To declare that
&ldquo;I would not stay&rdquo; in life if science proves us to be
&ldquo;cunning casts in clay,&rdquo; is beneath the courage of
the Stoical philosophy.</p>
<p>Theologically, the poem represents the struggle with doubts
and hopes and fears, which had been with Tennyson from his
boyhood, as is proved by the volume of 1830.&nbsp; But the doubts
had exerted, probably, but little influence on his happiness till
the sudden stroke of loss made life for a time seem almost
unbearable unless the doubts were solved.&nbsp; They <i>were</i>
solved, or stoically set aside, in the <i>Ulysses</i>, written in
the freshness of grief, with the conclusion that we must be</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Strong
in will<br />
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the gnawing of grief till it becomes a physical pain, the
fever fits of sorrow, the aching <i>desiderium</i>, bring back in
many guises the old questions.&nbsp; These require new attempts
at answers, and are answered, &ldquo;the sad mechanic
exercise&rdquo; of verse allaying the pain.&nbsp; This is the
genesis of <i>In Memoriam</i>, not originally written for
publication but produced at last as a monument to friendship, and
as a book of consolation.</p>
<p>No books of consolation can console except by sympathy; and in
<i>In Memoriam</i> sympathy and relief have been found, and will
be found, by many.&nbsp; Another, we feel, has trodden our dark
and stony path, has been shadowed by the shapes of dread which
haunt our valley of tribulation: a mind almost infinitely greater
than ours has been our fellow-sufferer.&nbsp; He has emerged from
the darkness of the shadow of death into the light, whither, as
it seems to us, we can scarcely hope to come.&nbsp; It is the
sympathy and the example, I think, not the speculations, mystical
or scientific, which make <i>In Memoriam</i>, in more than name,
a book of consolation: even in hours of the sharpest distress,
when its technical beauties and wonderful pictures seem shadowy
and unreal, like the yellow sunshine and the woods of that autumn
day when a man learned that his friend was dead.&nbsp; No, it was
not the speculations and arguments that consoled or encouraged
us.&nbsp; We did not listen to Tennyson as to Mr Frederic
Harrison&rsquo;s glorified Anglican clergyman.&nbsp; We could not
murmur, like the Queen of the May&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That good man, the Laureate, has told us
words of peace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we valued was the poet&rsquo;s companionship.&nbsp; There
was a young reader to whom <i>All along the Valley</i> came as a
new poem in a time of recent sorrow.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The two-and-thirty years were a mist that
rolls away,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>said the singer of <i>In Memoriam</i>, and in that hour it
seemed as if none could endure for two-and-thirty years the
companionship of loss.&nbsp; But the years have gone by, and have
left</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ever young the face that
dwells<br />
With reason cloister&rsquo;d in the brain.&rdquo; <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way to many <i>In Memoriam</i> is almost a life-long
companion: we walk with Great-heart for our guide through the
valley Perilous.</p>
<p>In this respect <i>In Memoriam</i> is unique, for neither to
its praise nor dispraise is it to be compared with the other
famous elegies of the world.&nbsp; These are brief outbursts of
grief&mdash;real, as in the hopeless words of Catullus over his
brother&rsquo;s tomb; or academic, like Milton&rsquo;s
<i>Lycidas</i>.&nbsp; We are not to suppose that Milton was
heart-broken by the death of young Mr King, or that Shelley was
greatly desolated by the death of Keats, with whom his personal
relations had been slight, and of whose poetry he had spoken
evil.&nbsp; He was nobly stirred as a poet by a poet&rsquo;s
death&mdash;like Mr Swinburne by the death of Charles Baudelaire;
but neither Shelley nor Mr Swinburne was lamenting <i>dimidium
anim&aelig; su&aelig;</i>, or mourning for a friend</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dear as
the mother to the son,<br />
More than my brothers are to me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The passion of <i>In Memoriam</i> is personal, is acute, is
life-long, and thus it differs from the other elegies.&nbsp;
Moreover, it celebrates a noble object, and thus is unlike the
ambiguous affection, real or dramatic, which informs the sonnets
of Shakespeare.&nbsp; So the poem stands alone, cloistered; not
fiery with indignation, not breaking into actual prophecy, like
Shelley&rsquo;s <i>Adonais</i>; not capable, by reason even of
its meditative metre, of the organ music of <i>Lycidas</i>.&nbsp;
Yet it is not to be reckoned inferior to these because its aim
and plan are other than theirs.</p>
<p>It is far from my purpose to &ldquo;class&rdquo; Tennyson, or
to dispute about his relative greatness when compared with
Wordsworth or Byron, Coleridge, Shelley, or Burns.&nbsp; He rated
one song of Lovelace above all his lyrics, and, in fact, could no
more have written the Cavalier&rsquo;s <i>To Althea from
Prison</i> than Lovelace could have written the <i>Morte
d&rsquo;Arthur</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not reasonable, it is not
fair,&rdquo; says Mr Harrison, after comparing <i>In Memoriam</i>
with <i>Lycidas</i>, &ldquo;to compare Tennyson with
Milton,&rdquo; and it is not reasonable to compare Tennyson with
any poet whatever.&nbsp; Criticism is not the construction of a
class list.&nbsp; But we may reasonably say that <i>In
Memoriam</i> is a noble poem, an original poem, a poem which
stands alone in literature.&nbsp; The wonderful beauty, ever
fresh, howsoever often read, of many stanzas, is not denied by
any critic.&nbsp; The marvel is that the same serene certainty of
art broods over even the stanzas which must have been conceived
while the sorrow was fresh.&nbsp; The second piece,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Old yew, which graspest at the
stones,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>must have been composed soon after the stroke fell.&nbsp; Yet
it is as perfect as the proem of 1849.&nbsp; As a rule, the
poetical expression of strong emotion appears usually to clothe
the memory of passion when it has been softened by time.&nbsp;
But here already &ldquo;the rhythm, phrasing, and articulation
are entirely faultless, exquisitely clear, melodious, and
rare.&rdquo; <a name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a>&nbsp; It were superfluous labour to
point at special beauties, at the exquisite rendering of nature;
and copious commentaries exist to explain the course of the
argument, if a series of moods is to be called an argument.&nbsp;
One may note such a point as that (xiv.) where the poet says
that, were he to meet his friend in life,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I should not feel it to be
strange.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may have happened to many to mistake, for a section of a
second, the face of a stranger for the face seen only in dreams,
and to find that the recognition brings no surprise.</p>
<p>Pieces of a character apart from the rest, and placed in a
designed sequence, are xcii., xciii., xcv.&nbsp; In the first the
poet says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If any vision should reveal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy likeness, I might count it vain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As but the canker of the brain;<br />
Yea, tho&rsquo; it spake and made appeal</p>
<p>To chances where our lots were cast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Together in the days behind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I might but say, I hear a wind<br />
Of memory murmuring the past.</p>
<p>Yea, tho&rsquo; it spake and bared to view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fact within the coming year;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tho&rsquo; the months, revolving near,<br />
Should prove the phantom-warning true,</p>
<p>They might not seem thy prophecies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But spiritual presentiments,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And such refraction of events<br />
As often rises ere they rise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author thus shows himself <i>difficile</i> as to
recognising the personal identity of a phantasm; nor is it easy
to see what mode of proving his identity would be left to a
spirit.&nbsp; The poet, therefore, appeals to some perhaps less
satisfactory experience:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Descend, and touch, and enter; hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wish too strong for words to name;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That in this blindness of the frame<br />
My Ghost may feel that thine is near.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third poem is the crown of <i>In Memoriam</i>, expressing
almost such things as are not given to man to utter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all at once it seem&rsquo;d
at last<br />
The living soul was flash&rsquo;d on mine,</p>
<p>And mine in this was wound, and whirl&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About empyreal heights of thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And came on that which is, and caught<br />
The deep pulsations of the world,</p>
<p>&AElig;onian music measuring out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The steps of Time&mdash;the shocks of
Chance&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blows of Death.&nbsp; At length my trance<br />
Was cancell&rsquo;d, stricken thro&rsquo; with doubt.</p>
<p>Vague words! but ah, how hard to frame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In matter-moulded forms of speech,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or ev&rsquo;n for intellect to reach<br />
Thro&rsquo; memory that which I became.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Experiences like this, subjective, and not matter for
argument, were familiar to Tennyson.&nbsp; Jowett said, &ldquo;He
was one of those who, though not an upholder of miracles, thought
that the wonders of Heaven and Earth were never far absent from
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; In <i>The Mystic</i>, Tennyson, when almost a
boy, had shown familiarity with strange psychological and
psychical conditions.&nbsp; Poems of much later life also deal
with these, and, more or less consciously, his philosophy was
tinged, and his confidence that we are more than &ldquo;cunning
casts in clay&rdquo; was increased, by phenomena of experience,
which can only be evidence for the mystic himself, if even for
him.&nbsp; But this dim aspect of his philosophy, of course, is
&ldquo;to the Greeks foolishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His was a philosophy of his own; not a philosophy for
disciples, and &ldquo;those that eddy round and
round.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the sum of his reflection on the mass
of his impressions.&nbsp; I have shown, by the aid of dates, that
it was not borrowed from Huxley, Mr Stopford Brooke, or the late
Duke of Argyll.&nbsp; But, no doubt, many of the ideas were
&ldquo;in the air,&rdquo; and must have presented themselves to
minds at once of religious tendency, and attracted by the
evolutionary theories which had always existed as floating
speculations, till they were made current coin by the genius and
patient study of Darwin.&nbsp; That Tennyson&rsquo;s opinions
between 1830 and 1840 were influenced by those of F. D. Maurice
is reckoned probable by Canon Ainger, author of the notice of the
poet in <i>The Dictionary of National Biography</i>.&nbsp; In the
Life of Maurice, Tennyson does not appear till 1850, and the two
men were not at Cambridge together.&nbsp; But Maurice&rsquo;s
ideas, as they then existed, may have reached Tennyson orally
through Hallam and other members of the Trinity set, who knew
personally the author of <i>Letters to a Quaker</i>.&nbsp;
However, this is no question of scientific priority: to myself it
seems that Tennyson &ldquo;beat his music out&rdquo; for himself,
as perhaps most people do.&nbsp; Like his own Sir Percivale,
&ldquo;I know not all he meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the opinions as to <i>In Memoriam</i> current at the
time of its publication Lord Tennyson notices those of Maurice
and Robertson.&nbsp; They &ldquo;thought that the poet had made a
definite step towards the unification of the highest religion and
philosophy with the progressive science of the day.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Neither science nor religion stands still; neither stands now
where it then did.&nbsp; Conceivably they are travelling on paths
which will ultimately coincide; but this opinion, of course, must
seem foolishness to most professors of science.&nbsp; Bishop
Westcott was at Cambridge when the book appeared: he is one of Mr
Harrison&rsquo;s possible sources of Tennyson&rsquo;s
ideas.&nbsp; He recognised the poet&rsquo;s &ldquo;splendid faith
(in the face of every difficulty) in the growing purpose of the
sum of life, and in the noble destiny of the individual
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ten years later Professor Henry Sidgwick, a
mind sufficiently sceptical, found in some lines of <i>In
Memoriam</i> &ldquo;the indestructible and inalienable minimum of
faith which humanity cannot give up because it is necessary for
life; and which I know that I, at least so far as the man in me
is deeper than the methodical thinker, cannot give
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we know that many persons not only do not
find an irreducible minimum of faith &ldquo;necessary for
life,&rdquo; but are highly indignant and contemptuous if any one
else ventures to suggest the logical possibility of any faith at
all.</p>
<p>The mass of mankind will probably never be convinced
unbelievers&mdash;nay, probably the backward or forward swing of
the pendulum will touch more convinced belief.&nbsp; But there
always have been, since the <i>Rishis</i> of India sang, superior
persons who believe in nothing not material&mdash;whatever the
material may be.&nbsp; Tennyson was, it is said,
&ldquo;impatient&rdquo; of these <i>esprits forts</i>, and they
are impatient of him.&nbsp; It is an error to be impatient: we
know not whither the <i>logos</i> may lead us, or later
generations; and we ought not to be irritated with others because
it leads them into what we think the wrong path.&nbsp; It is
unfortunate that a work of art, like <i>In Memoriam</i>, should
arouse theological or anti-theological passions.&nbsp; The poet
only shows us the paths by which his mind travelled: they may not
be the right paths, nor is it easy to trace them on a
philosophical chart.&nbsp; He escaped from Doubting Castle.&nbsp;
Others may &ldquo;take that for a hermitage,&rdquo; and be happy
enough in the residence.&nbsp; We are all determined by our bias:
Tennyson&rsquo;s is unconcealed.&nbsp; His poem is not a tract:
it does not aim at the conversion of people with the contrary
bias, it is irksome, in writing about a poet, to be obliged to
discuss a philosophy which, certainly, is not stated in the
manner of Spinoza, but is merely the equilibrium of contending
forces in a single mind.</p>
<p>The most famous review of <i>In Memoriam</i> is that which
declared that &ldquo;these touching lines evidently come from the
full heart of the widow of a military man.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
only equalled, if equalled, by a recent critique which treated a
fresh edition of <i>Jane Eyre</i> as a new novel, &ldquo;not
without power, in parts, and showing some knowledge of Yorkshire
local colour.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>VI.<br
/>
AFTER <i>IN MEMORIAM</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> June 13 Tennyson married, at
Shiplake, the object of his old, long-tried, and constant
affection.&nbsp; The marriage was still
&ldquo;imprudent,&rdquo;&mdash;eight years of then uncontested
supremacy in English poetry had not brought a golden
harvest.&nbsp; Mr Moxon appears to have supplied &pound;300
&ldquo;in advance of royalties.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sum, so
contemptible in the eyes of first-rate modern novelists, was a
competence to Tennyson, added to his little pension and the
<i>&eacute;paves</i> of his patrimony.&nbsp; &ldquo;The peace of
God came into my life when I married her,&rdquo; he said in later
days.&nbsp; The poet made a charming copy of verses to his
friend, the Rev. Mr Rawnsley, who tied the knot, as he and his
bride drove to the beautiful village of Pangbourne.&nbsp; Thence
they went to the stately Clevedon Court, the seat of Sir Abraham
Elton, hard by the church where Arthur Hallam sleeps.&nbsp; The
place is very ancient and beautiful, and was a favourite haunt of
Thackeray.&nbsp; They passed on to Lynton, and to Glastonbury,
where a collateral ancestor of Mrs Tennyson&rsquo;s is buried
beside King Arthur&rsquo;s grave, in that green valley of
Avilion, among the apple-blossoms.&nbsp; They settled for a while
at Tent Lodge on Coniston Water, in a land of hospitable
Marshalls.</p>
<p>After their return to London, on the night of November 18,
Tennyson dreamed that Prince Albert came and kissed him, and that
he himself said, &ldquo;Very kind, but very German,&rdquo; which
was very like him.&nbsp; Next day he received from Windsor the
offer of the Laureateship.&nbsp; He doubted, and hesitated, but
accepted.&nbsp; Since Wordsworth&rsquo;s death there had, as
usual, been a good deal of banter about the probable new
Laureate: examples of competitive odes exist in <i>Bon
Gaultier</i>.&nbsp; That by Tennyson is Anacreontic, but he was
not really set on kissing the Maids of Honour, as he is made to
sing.&nbsp; Rogers had declined, on the plea of extreme old age;
but it was worthy of the great and good Queen not to overlook the
Nestor of English poets.&nbsp; For the rest, the Queen looked for
&ldquo;a name bearing such distinction in the literary world as
to do credit to the appointment.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the previous
century the great poets had rarely been Laureates.&nbsp; But
since Sir Walter Scott declined the bays in favour of Southey,
for whom, again, the tale of bricks in the way of Odes was
lightened, and when Wordsworth succeeded Southey, the office
became honourable.&nbsp; Tennyson gave it an increase of renown,
while, though in itself of merely nominal value, it served his
poems, to speak profanely, as an advertisement.&nbsp; New
editions of his books were at once in demand; while few readers
had ever heard of Mr Browning, already his friend, and already
author of <i>Men and Women</i>.</p>
<p>The Laureateship brought the poet acquainted with the Queen,
who was to be his debtor in later days for encouragement and
consolation.&nbsp; To his Laureateship we owe, among other good
things, the stately and moving <i>Ode on the Death of the Duke of
Wellington</i>, a splendid heroic piece, unappreciated at the
moment.&nbsp; But Tennyson was, of course, no Birthday
poet.&nbsp; Since the exile of the House of Stuart our kings in
England have not maintained the old familiarity with many classes
of their subjects.&nbsp; Literature has not been fashionable at
Court, and Tennyson could in no age have been a courtier.&nbsp;
We hear the complaint, every now and then, that official honours
are not conferred (except the Laureateship) on men of
letters.&nbsp; But most of them probably think it rather
distinguished not to be decorated, or to carry titles borne by
many deserving persons unvisited by the Muses.&nbsp; Even the
appointment to the bays usually provokes a great deal of jealous
and spiteful feeling, which would only be multiplied if official
honours were distributed among men of the pen.&nbsp; Perhaps
Tennyson&rsquo;s laurels were not for nothing in the chorus of
dispraise which greeted the <i>Ode on the Duke of Wellington</i>,
and <i>Maud</i>.</p>
<p>The year 1851 was chiefly notable for a tour to Italy, made
immortal in the beautiful poem of <i>The Daisy</i>, in a measure
of the poet&rsquo;s own invention.&nbsp; The next year, following
on the <i>Coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i> and the rise of the new
French empire, produced patriotic appeals to Britons to
&ldquo;guard their own,&rdquo; which to a great extent former
alien owners had been unsuccessful in guarding from
Britons.&nbsp; The Tennysons had lost their first child at his
birth: perhaps he is remembered in <i>The Grandmother</i>,
&ldquo;the babe had fought for his life.&rdquo;&nbsp; In August
1852 the present Lord Tennyson was born, and Mr Maurice was asked
to be godfather.&nbsp; The Wellington Ode was of November, and
was met by &ldquo;the almost universal depreciation of the
press,&rdquo;&mdash;why, except because, as I have just
suggested, Tennyson was Laureate, it is impossible to
imagine.&nbsp; The verses were worthy of the occasion: more they
could not be.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1853 the poet visited Ardtornish on the Sound
of Mull, a beautiful place endeared to him who now writes by the
earliest associations.&nbsp; It chanced to him to pass his
holidays there just when Tennyson and Mr Palgrave had
left&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Tinsmith and Mr Pancake,&rdquo; as Robert
the boatman, a very black Celt, called them.&nbsp; Being then
nine years of age, I heard of a poet&rsquo;s visit, and asked,
&ldquo;A real poet, like Sir Walter Scott?&rdquo; with whom I
then supposed that &ldquo;the Muse had gone away.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, not like Sir Walter Scott, of course,&rdquo; my mother
told me, with loyalty unashamed.&nbsp; One can think of the poet
as Mrs Sellar, his hostess, describes him, beneath the limes of
the avenue at Acharn, planted, Mrs Sellar says, by a cousin of
Flora Macdonald.&nbsp; I have been told that the lady who planted
the lilies, if not the limes, was the famed Jacobite, Miss Jennie
Cameron, mentioned in <i>Tom Jones</i>.&nbsp; An English
engraving of 1746 shows the Prince between these two beauties,
Flora and Jennie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; says Mrs Sellar, &ldquo;could have been
more easy, simple, and delightful,&rdquo; and indeed it is no
marvel that in her society and that of her husband, the Greek
professor, and her cousin, Miss Cross, and in such scenes,
&ldquo;he blossomed out in the most genial manner, making us all
feel as if he were an old friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November Tennyson took a house at Farringford, &ldquo;as it
was beautiful and far from the haunts of men.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
he settled to a country existence in the society of his wife, his
two children (the second, Lionel, being in 1854 the baby), and
there he composed <i>Maud</i>, while the sound of the guns, in
practice for the war of the Crimea, boomed from the coast.&nbsp;
In May Tennyson saw the artists, of schools oddly various, who
illustrated his poems.&nbsp; Millais, Rossetti, and Holman Hunt
gave the tone to the art, but Mr Horsley, Creswick, and Mulgrave
were also engaged.&nbsp; While <i>Maud</i> was being composed
Tennyson wrote <i>The Charge of the Light Brigade</i>; a famous
poem, not in a manner in which he was born to excel&mdash;at
least in my poor opinion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some one <i>had</i>
blundered,&rdquo; and that line was the first fashioned and the
keynote of the poem; but, after all, &ldquo;blundered&rdquo; is
not an exquisite rhyme to &ldquo;hundred.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poem,
in any case, was most welcome to our army in the Crimea, and is a
spirited piece for recitation.</p>
<p>In January 1855 <i>Maud</i> was finished; in April the poet
copied it out for the press, and refreshed himself by reading a
very different poem, <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>.&nbsp; The
author, Sir Walter, had suffered, like the hero of <i>Maud</i>,
by an unhappy love affair, which just faintly colours <i>The Lady
of the Lake</i> by a single allusion, in the description of
Fitz-James&rsquo;s dreams:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then,&mdash;from my couch may heavenly
might<br />
Chase that worst phantom of the night!&mdash;<br />
Again returned the scenes of youth,<br />
Of confident undoubting truth;<br />
Again his soul he interchanged<br />
With friends whose hearts were long estranged.<br />
They come, in dim procession led,<br />
The cold, the faithless, and the dead;<br />
As warm each hand, each brow as gay,<br />
As if they parted yesterday.<br />
And doubt distracts him at the view&mdash;<br />
Oh, were his senses false or true?<br />
Dreamed he of death, or broken vow,<br />
Or is it all a vision now?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We learn from Lady Louisa Stuart, to whom Scott read these
lines, that they referred to his lost love.&nbsp; I cite the
passage because the extreme reticence of Scott, in his undying
sorrow, is in contrast with what Tennyson, after reading <i>The
Lady of the Lake</i>, was putting into the mouth of his
complaining lover in <i>Maud</i>.</p>
<p>We have no reason to suppose that Tennyson himself had ever to
bewail a faithless love.&nbsp; To be sure, the hero of
<i>Locksley Hall</i> is in this attitude, but then <i>Locksley
Hall</i> is not autobiographical.&nbsp; Less dramatic and
impersonal in appearance are the stanzas&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come not, when I am dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To drop thy foolish tears upon my grave;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Child, if it were thine error or thy
crime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I care no longer, being all unblest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No biographer tells us whether this was a personal complaint
or a mere set of verses on an imaginary occasion.&nbsp; In <i>In
Memoriam</i> Tennyson speaks out concerning the loss of a
friend.&nbsp; In <i>Maud</i>, as in <i>Locksley Hall</i>, he
makes his hero reveal the agony caused by the loss of a
mistress.&nbsp; There is no reason to suppose that the poet had
ever any such mischance, but many readers have taken <i>Locksley
Hall</i> and <i>Maud</i> for autobiographical revelations, like
<i>In Memoriam</i>.&nbsp; They are, on the other hand,
imaginative and dramatic.&nbsp; They illustrate the pangs of
disappointed love of woman, pangs more complex and more rankling
than those inflicted by death.&nbsp; In each case, however, the
poet, who has sung so nobly the happiness of fortunate wedded
loves, has chosen a hero with whom we do not readily
sympathise&mdash;a Hamlet in miniature,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With a heart of furious fancies,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as in the old mad song.&nbsp; This choice, thanks to the
popular misconception, did him some harm.&nbsp; As a
&ldquo;monodramatic Idyll,&rdquo; a romance in many rich lyric
measures, <i>Maud</i> was at first excessively unpopular.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>Maud</i> is Tennyson&rsquo;s
Maudlin,&rdquo; said a satirist, and &ldquo;morbid,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mad,&rdquo; &ldquo;rampant,&rdquo; and &ldquo;rabid
bloodthirstiness of soul,&rdquo; were among the amenities of
criticism.&nbsp; Tennyson hated war, but his hero, at least,
hopes that national union in a national struggle will awake a
nobler than the commercial spirit.&nbsp; Into the rights and
wrongs of our quarrel with Russia we are not to go.&nbsp;
Tennyson, rightly or wrongly, took the part of his country, and
must &ldquo;thole the feud&rdquo; of those high-souled citizens
who think their country always in the wrong&mdash;as perhaps it
very frequently is.&nbsp; We are not to expect a tranquil absence
of bias in the midst of military excitement, when very laudable
sentiments are apt to misguide men in both directions.&nbsp; In
any case, political partisanship added to the enemies of the
poem, which was applauded by Henry Taylor, Ruskin, George
Brimley, and Jowett, while Mrs Browning sent consoling words from
Italy.&nbsp; The poem remained a favourite with the author, who
chose passages from it often, when persuaded to read aloud by
friends; and modern criticism has not failed to applaud the
splendour of the verse and the subtlety of the mad scenes, the
passion of the love lyrics.</p>
<p>These merits have ceased to be disputed, but, though a loyal
Tennysonian, I have never quite been able to reconcile myself to
<i>Maud</i> as a whole.&nbsp; The hero is an unwholesome young
man, and not of an original kind.&nbsp; He is <i>un beau
t&eacute;n&eacute;breux</i> of 1830.&nbsp; I suppose it has been
observed that he is merely The Master of Ravenswood in modern
costume, and without Lady Ashton.&nbsp; Her part is taken by
Maud&rsquo;s brother.&nbsp; The situations of the hero and of the
Master (whose acquaintance Thackeray never renewed after he lost
his hat in the Kelpie Flow) are nearly identical.&nbsp; The
families and fathers of both have been ruined by &ldquo;the gray
old wolf,&rdquo; and by Sir William Ashton, representing the
house of Stair.&nbsp; Both heroes live dawdling on, hard by their
lost ancestral homes.&nbsp; Both fall in love with the daughters
of the enemies of their houses.&nbsp; The loves of both are
baffled, and end in tragedy.&nbsp; Both are concerned in a duel,
though the Master, on his way to the ground, &ldquo;stables his
steed in the Kelpie Flow,&rdquo; and the wooer in <i>Maud</i>
shoots Lucy Ashton&rsquo;s brother,&mdash;I mean the brother of
Maud,&mdash;though duelling in England was out of date.&nbsp;
Then comes an interval of madness, and he recovers amid the
patriotic emotions of the ill-fated Crimean expedition.&nbsp;
Both lovers are gloomy, though the Master has better cause, for
the Tennysonian hero is more comfortably provided for than Edgar
with his &ldquo;man and maid,&rdquo; his Caleb and Mysie.&nbsp;
Finally, both <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>, which affected
Tennyson so potently in boyhood</p>
<blockquote><p>(&ldquo;<i>A merry merry bridal</i>,<br />
<i>A merry merry day</i>&rdquo;),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <i>Maud</i>, excel in passages rather than as wholes.</p>
<p>The hero of <i>Maud</i>, with his clandestine wooing of a girl
of sixteen, has this apology, that the match had been, as it
were, predestined, and desired by the mother of the lady.&nbsp;
Still, the brother did not ill to be angry; and the peevishness
of the hero against the brother and the parvenu lord and rival
strikes a jarring note.&nbsp; In England, at least, the general
sentiment is opposed to this moody, introspective kind of young
man, of whom Tennyson is not to be supposed to approve.&nbsp; We
do not feel certain that his man and maid were &ldquo;ever ready
to slander and steal.&rdquo;&nbsp; That seems to be part of his
jaundiced way of looking at everything and everybody.&nbsp; He
has even a bad word for the &ldquo;man-god&rdquo; of modern
days,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The man of science himself is fonder of
glory, and vain,<br />
An eye well-practised in nature, a spirit bounded and
poor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Rien n&rsquo;est sacr&eacute;</i> for this cynic, who
thinks himself a Stoic.&nbsp; Thus <i>Maud</i> was made to be
unpopular with the author&rsquo;s countrymen, who conceived a
prejudice against Maud&rsquo;s lover, described by Tennyson as
&ldquo;a morbid poetic soul, . . . an egotist with the makings of
a cynic.&rdquo;&nbsp; That he is &ldquo;raised to sanity&rdquo;
(still in Tennyson&rsquo;s words) &ldquo;by a pure and holy love
which elevates his whole nature,&rdquo; the world failed to
perceive, especially as the sanity was only a brief lucid
interval, tempered by hanging about the garden to meet a girl of
sixteen, unknown to her relations.&nbsp; Tennyson added that
&ldquo;different phases of passion in one person take the place
of different characters,&rdquo; to which critics replied that
they wanted different characters, if only by way of relief, and
did not care for any of the phases of passion.&nbsp; The learned
Monsieur Janet has maintained that love is a disease like
another, and that nobody falls in love when in perfect health of
mind and body.&nbsp; This theory seems open to exception, but the
hero of Maud is unhealthy enough.&nbsp; At best and last, he only
helps to give a martial force a
&ldquo;send-off&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I stood on a giant deck and mixed my
breath<br />
With a loyal people shouting a battle-cry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did not go out as a volunteer, and probably the Crimean
winters brought him back to his original estate of cynical
gloom&mdash;and very naturally.</p>
<p>The reconciliation with Life is not like the reconciliation of
<i>In Memoriam</i>.&nbsp; The poem took its rise in old lines,
and most beautiful lines, which Tennyson had contributed in 1837
to a miscellany:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O that &rsquo;twere possible,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; After long grief and pain,<br />
To find the arms of my true love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round me once again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thence the poet, working back to find the origin of the
situation, encountered the ideas and the persons of
<i>Maud</i>.</p>
<p>I have tried to state the sources, in the general mind, of the
general dislike of <i>Maud</i>.&nbsp; The public, &ldquo;driving
at practice,&rdquo; disapproved of the &ldquo;criticism of
life&rdquo; in the poem; confused the suffering narrator with the
author, and neglected the poetry.&nbsp; &ldquo;No modern
poem,&rdquo; said Jowett, &ldquo;contains more lines that ring in
the ears of men.&nbsp; I do not know any verse out of Shakespeare
in which the ecstacy of love soars to such a height.&rdquo;&nbsp;
With these comments we may agree, yet may fail to follow Jowett
when he says, &ldquo;No poem since Shakespeare seems to show
equal power of the same kind, or equal knowledge of human
nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare could not in a narrative poem
have preferred the varying passions of one character to the
characters of many persons.</p>
<p>Tennyson was &ldquo;nettled at first,&rdquo; his son says,
&ldquo;by these captious remarks of the &lsquo;indolent
reviewers,&rsquo; but afterwards he would take no notice of them
except to speak of them in a half-pitiful, half-humorous,
half-mournful manner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The besetting sin and error of
the critics was, of course, to confound Tennyson&rsquo;s hero
with himself, as if we confused Dickens with Pip.</p>
<p>Like <i>Aurora Leigh</i>, <i>Lucile</i>, and other works,
<i>Maud</i> is under the disadvantage of being, practically, a
novel of modern life in verse.&nbsp; Criticised as a tale of
modern life (and it was criticised in that character), it could
not be very highly esteemed.&nbsp; But the essence of
<i>Maud</i>, of course, lies in the poetical vehicle.&nbsp;
Nobody can cavil at the impressiveness of the opening
stanzas&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I hate the dreadful hollow behind the
little wood&rdquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with the keynotes of colour and of desolation struck; the lips
of the hollow &ldquo;dabbled with blood-red heath,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;red-ribb&rsquo;d ledges,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the flying gold
of the ruin&rsquo;d woodlands&rdquo;; and the contrast in the
picture of the child Maud&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Maud the delight of the village, the
ringing joy of the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poem abounds in lines which live in the memory, as in the
vernal description&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A million emeralds break from the
ruby-budded lime&rdquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the voice heard in the garden singing</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A passionate ballad gallant and
gay,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as Lovelace&rsquo;s <i>Althea</i>, and the lines on the
far-off waving of a white hand, &ldquo;betwixt the cloud and the
moon.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lyric of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Birds in the high Hall-garden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When twilight was falling,<br />
Maud, Maud, Maud, Maud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were crying and calling,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was a favourite of the poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What birds were these?&rdquo; he is said to have asked
a lady suddenly, when reading to a silent company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nightingales,&rdquo; suggested a listener, who did not
probably remember any other fowl that is vocal in the dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they were rooks,&rdquo; answered the poet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the Garden, Maud,&rdquo; is as fine a
love-song as Tennyson ever wrote, with a triumphant ring, and a
soaring exultant note.&nbsp; Then the poem drops from its height,
like a lark shot high in heaven; tragedy comes, and remorse, and
the beautiful interlude of the</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;lovely shell,<br />
Small and pure as a pearl.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows the exquisite</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O that &rsquo;twere possible,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the dull consciousness of the poem of madness, with its
dumb gnawing confusion of pain and wandering memory; the hero
being finally left, in the author&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;sane but
shattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tennyson&rsquo;s letters of the time show that the critics
succeeded in wounding him: it was not a difficult thing to
do.&nbsp; <i>Maud</i> was threatened with a broadside from
&ldquo;that pompholygous, broad-blown Apollodorus, the gifted
X.&rdquo;&nbsp; People who have read Aytoun&rsquo;s diverting
<i>Firmilian</i>, where Apollodorus plays his part, and who
remember &ldquo;gifted Gilfillan&rdquo; in <i>Waverley</i>, know
who the gifted X. was.&nbsp; But X. was no great authority south
of Tay.</p>
<p>Despite the almost unanimous condemnation by public critics,
the success of <i>Maud</i> enabled Tennyson to buy Farringford,
so he must have been better appreciated and understood by the
world than by the reviewers.</p>
<p>In February 1850 Tennyson returned to his old Arthurian
themes, &ldquo;the only big thing not done,&rdquo; for Milton had
merely glanced at Arthur, Dryden did not</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Raise the Table Round again,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Blackmore has never been reckoned adequate.&nbsp;
<i>Vivien</i> was first composed as <i>Merlin and Nimue</i>, and
then <i>Geraint and Enid</i> was adapted from the
<i>Mabinogion</i>, the Welsh collection of <i>M&auml;rchen</i>
and legends, things of widely different ages, now rather Celtic,
or Brythonic, now amplifications made under the influence of
medi&aelig;val French romance.&nbsp; <i>Enid</i> was finished in
Wales in August, and Tennyson learned Welsh enough to be able to
read the <i>Mabinogion</i>, which is much more of Welsh than many
Arthurian critics possess.&nbsp; The two first Idylls were
privately printed in the summer of 1857, being very rare and much
desired of collectors in this embryonic shape.&nbsp; In July
<i>Guinevere</i> was begun, in the middle, with Arthur&rsquo;s
valedictory address to his erring consort.&nbsp; In autumn
Tennyson visited the late Duke of Argyll at Inveraray: he was
much attached to the Duke&mdash;unlike Professor Huxley.&nbsp;
Their love of nature, the Duke being as keen-eyed as the poet was
short-sighted, was one tie of union.&nbsp; The Indian Mutiny, or
at least the death of Havelock, was the occasion of lines which
the author was too wise to include in any of his volumes: the
poem on Lucknow was of later composition.</p>
<p><i>Guinevere</i> was completed in March 1858; and Tennyson met
Mr Swinburne, then very young.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I particularly
admired in him was that he did not press upon me any verses of
his own.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tennyson would have found more to admire if
he had pressed for a sight of the verses.&nbsp; Neither he nor Mr
Matthew Arnold was very encouraging to young poets: they had no
sons in Apollo, like Ben Jonson.&nbsp; But both were kept in a
perpetual state of apprehension by the army of versifiers who
send volumes by post, to whom that can only be said what Tennyson
did say to one of them, &ldquo;As an amusement to yourself and
your friends, the writing it&rdquo; (verse) &ldquo;is all very
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the friends who do not find it amusing,
while the stranger becomes the foe.&nbsp; The psychology of these
pests of the Muses is bewildering.&nbsp; They do not seem to read
poetry, only to write it and launch it at unoffending
strangers.&nbsp; If they bought each other&rsquo;s books, all of
them could afford to publish.</p>
<p>The Master of Balliol, the most adviceful man, if one may use
the term, of his age, appears to have advised Tennyson to publish
the <i>Idylls</i> at once.&nbsp; There had been years of silence
since <i>Maud</i>, and the Master suspected that
&ldquo;mosquitoes&rdquo; (reviewers) were the cause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is a note needed to show the good side of human
nature and to condone its frailties which Thackeray will never
strike.&rdquo;&nbsp; To others it seems that Thackeray was
eternally striking this note: at that time in General Lambert,
his wife, and daughters, not to speak of other characters in
<i>The Virginians</i>.&nbsp; Who does not condone the frailties
of Captain Costigan, and F. B., and the Chevalier Strong?&nbsp;
In any case, Tennyson took his own time, he was (1858) only
beginning <i>Elaine</i>.&nbsp; There is no doubt that Tennyson
was easily pricked by unsympathetic criticism, even from the most
insignificant source, and, as he confessed, he received little
pleasure from praise.&nbsp; All authors, without exception, are
sensitive.&nbsp; A sturdier author wrote that he would sometimes
have been glad to meet his assailant &ldquo;where the muir-cock
was bailie.&rdquo;&nbsp; We know how testily Wordsworth replied
in defence to the gentlest comments by Lamb.</p>
<p>The Master of Balliol kept insisting, &ldquo;As to the
critics, their power is not really great. . . .&nbsp; One drop of
natural feeling in poetry or the true statement of a single new
fact is already felt to be of more value than all the critics put
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet even critics may be in the right, and
of all great poets, Tennyson listened most obediently to their
censures, as we have seen in the case of his early poems.&nbsp;
His prolonged silences after the attacks of 1833 and 1855 were
occupied in work and reflection: Achilles was not merely sulking
in his tent, as some of his friends seem to have supposed.&nbsp;
An epic in a series of epic idylls cannot be dashed off like a
romantic novel in rhyme; and Tennyson&rsquo;s method was always
one of waiting for maturity of conception and execution.</p>
<p>Mrs Tennyson, doubtless by her lord&rsquo;s desire, asked the
Master (then tutor of Balliol) to suggest themes.&nbsp; Old age
was suggested, and is treated in <i>The Grandmother</i>.&nbsp;
Other topics were not handled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hold most
strongly,&rdquo; said the Master, &ldquo;that it is the duty of
every one who has the good fortune to know a man of genius to do
any trifling service they can to lighten his work.&rdquo;&nbsp;
To do every service in his power to every man was the
Master&rsquo;s life-long practice.&nbsp; He was not much at home,
his letters show, with Burns, to whom he seems to have attributed
<i>John Anderson</i>, <i>my jo</i>, <i>John</i>, while he tells
an anecdote of Burns composing <i>Tam o&rsquo; Shanter</i> with
emotional tears, which, if true at all, is true of the making of
<i>To Mary in Heaven</i>.&nbsp; If Burns wept over <i>Tam
o&rsquo; Shanter</i>, the tears must have been tears of
laughter.</p>
<p>The first four <i>Idylls of the King</i> were prepared for
publication in the spring of 1859; while Tennyson was at work
also on <i>Pelleas and Ettarre</i>, and the Tristram cycle.&nbsp;
In autumn he went on a tour to Lisbon with Mr F. T. Palgrave and
Mr Craufurd Grove.&nbsp; Returning, he fell eagerly to reading an
early copy of Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Origin of Species</i>, the crown
of his own early speculations on the theory of evolution.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your theory does not make against Christianity?&rdquo; he
asked Darwin later (1868), who replied, &ldquo;No, certainly
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Darwin has stated the waverings of his own
mind in contact with a topic too high for <i>a priori</i>
reasoning, and only to be approached, if at all, on the strength
of the scientific method applied to facts which science, so far,
neglects, or denies, or &ldquo;explains away,&rdquo; rather than
explains.</p>
<p>The <i>Idylls</i>, unlike <i>Maud</i>, were well received by
the press, better by the public, and best of all by friends like
Thackeray, the Duke of Argyll, the Master of Balliol, and Clough,
while Ruskin showed some reserve.&nbsp; The letter from Thackeray
I cannot deny myself the pleasure of citing from the Biography:
it was written &ldquo;in an ardour of claret and
gratitude,&rdquo; but posted some six weeks later:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Folkestone</span>, <i>September</i>.<br />
36 <span class="smcap">Onslow Square</span>, <i>October</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear old Alfred</span>,&mdash;I owe you
a letter of happiness and thanks.&nbsp; Sir, about three weeks
ago, when I was ill in bed, I read the Idylls of the King, and I
thought, &ldquo;Oh, I must write to him now, for this pleasure,
this delight, this splendour of happiness which I have been
enjoying.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I should have blotted the sheets,
&rsquo;tis ill writing on one&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; The letter full
of gratitude never went as far as the post-office, and how comes
it now?</p>
<p>D&rsquo;abord, a bottle of claret.&nbsp; (The landlord of the
hotel asked me down to the cellar and treated me.)&nbsp; Then
afterwards sitting here, an old magazine, Fraser&rsquo;s
Magazine, 1850, and I come on a poem out of The Princess which
says, &ldquo;I hear the horns of Elfland blowing,
blowing,&rdquo;&mdash;no, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;the horns of Elfland
faintly blowing&rdquo; (I have been into my bedroom to fetch my
pen and it has made that blot), and, reading the lines, which
only one man in the world could write, I thought about the other
horns of Elfland blowing in full strength, and Arthur in gold
armour, and Guinevere in gold hair, and all those knights and
heroes and beauties and purple landscapes and misty gray lakes in
which you have made me live.&nbsp; They seem like facts to me,
since about three weeks ago (three weeks or a month was it?) when
I read the book.&nbsp; It is on the table yonder, and I
don&rsquo;t like, somehow, to disturb it, but the delight and
gratitude!&nbsp; You have made me as happy as I was as a child
with the Arabian Nights,&mdash;every step I have walked in
Elfland has been a sort of Paradise to me.&nbsp; (The landlord
gave two bottles of his claret and I think I drank the most) and
here I have been lying back in the chair and thinking of those
delightful Idylls, my thoughts being turned to you: what could I
do but be grateful to that surprising genius which has made me so
happy?&nbsp; Do you understand that what I mean is all true, and
that I should break out were you sitting opposite with a pipe in
your mouth?&nbsp; Gold and purple and diamonds, I say, gentlemen,
and glory and love and honour, and if you haven&rsquo;t given me
all these why should I be in such an ardour of gratitude?&nbsp;
But I have had out of that dear book the greatest delight that
has ever come to me since I was a young man; to write and think
about it makes me almost young, and this I suppose is what
I&rsquo;m doing, like an after-dinner speech.</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I thought the &ldquo;Grandmother&rdquo;
quite as fine.&nbsp; How can you at 50 be doing things as well as
at 35?</p>
<p>October 16th.&mdash;(I should think six weeks after the
writing of the above.)</p>
<p>The rhapsody of gratitude was never sent, and for a peculiar
reason: just about the time of writing I came to an arrangement
with Smith &amp; Elder to edit their new magazine, and to have a
contribution from T. was the publishers&rsquo; and editor&rsquo;s
highest ambition.&nbsp; But to ask a man for a favour, and to
praise and bow down before him in the same page, seemed to be so
like hypocrisy, that I held my hand, and left this note in my
desk, where it has been lying during a little
French-Italian-Swiss tour which my girls and their papa have been
making.</p>
<p>Meanwhile S. E. &amp; Co. have been making their own proposals
to you, and you have replied not favourably, I am sorry to hear;
but now there is no reason why you should not have my homages,
and I am just as thankful for the Idylls, and love and admire
them just as much, as I did two months ago when I began to write
in that ardour of claret and gratitude.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t
write for us you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If you can by chance some
day, and help an old friend, how pleased and happy I shall
be!&nbsp; This however must be left to fate and your convenience:
I don&rsquo;t intend to give up hope, but accept the good fortune
if it comes.&nbsp; I see one, two, three quarterlies advertised
to-day, as all bringing laurels to laureatus.&nbsp; He will not
refuse the private tribute of an old friend, will he?&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t know how pleased the girls were at Kensington
t&rsquo;other day to hear you quote their father&rsquo;s little
verses, and he too I daresay was not disgusted.&nbsp; He sends
you and yours his very best regards in this most heartfelt and
artless</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(note of admiration)!<br />
Always yours, my dear Alfred,<br />
W. M. <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally this letter gave Tennyson more pleasure than all the
converted critics with their favourable reviews.&nbsp; The Duke
of Argyll announced the conversion of Macaulay.&nbsp; The Master
found <i>Elaine</i> &ldquo;the fairest, sweetest, purest love
poem in the English language.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to the whole,
&ldquo;The allegory in the distance <i>greatly strengthens</i>,
<i>also elevates</i>, <i>the meaning of the poem</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruskin, like some other critics, felt &ldquo;the art and
finish in these poems a little more than I like to feel
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet <i>Guinevere</i> and <i>Elaine</i> had been
rapidly written and little corrected.&nbsp; I confess to the
opinion that what a man does most easily is, as a rule, what he
does best.&nbsp; We know that the &ldquo;art and finish&rdquo; of
Shakespeare were spontaneous, and so were those of
Tennyson.&nbsp; Perfection in art is sometimes more sudden than
we think, but then &ldquo;the long preparation for it,&mdash;that
unseen germination, <i>that</i> is what we ignore and
forget.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he wisely kept his pieces by him for a
long time, restudying them with a fresh eye.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;unreality&rdquo; of the subject also failed to please
Ruskin, as it is a stumbling-block to others.&nbsp; He wanted
poems on &ldquo;the living present,&rdquo; a theme not selected
by Homer, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton, Virgil, or the Greek
dramatists, except (among surviving plays) in the <i>Pers&aelig;
of</i> &AElig;schylus.&nbsp; The poet who can transfigure the hot
present is fortunate, but most, and the greatest, have visited
the cool quiet purlieus of the past.</p>
<h2><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>VII.<br />
THE IDYLLS OF THE KING.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Idylls may probably be best
considered in their final shape: they are not an epic, but a
series of heroic <i>idyllia</i> of the same genre as the heroic
<i>idyllia</i> of Theocritus.&nbsp; He wrote long after the
natural age of national epic, the age of Homer.&nbsp; He saw the
later literary epic rise in the <i>Argonautica</i> of Apollonius
Rhodius, a poem with many beauties, if rather an archaistic and
elaborate revival as a whole.&nbsp; The time for long narrative
poems, Theocritus appears to have thought, was past, and he only
ventured on the heroic <i>idyllia</i> of Heracles, and certain
adventures of the Argonauts.&nbsp; Tennyson, too, from the first
believed that his pieces ought to be short.&nbsp; Therefore,
though he had a conception of his work as a whole, a conception
long mused on, and sketched in various lights, he produced no
epic, only a series of epic <i>idyllia</i>.&nbsp; He had a
spiritual conception, &ldquo;an allegory in the distance,&rdquo;
an allegory not to be insisted upon, though its presence was to
be felt.&nbsp; No longer, as in youth, did Tennyson intend Merlin
to symbolise &ldquo;the sceptical understanding&rdquo; (as if one
were to &ldquo;break into blank the gospel of&rdquo; Herr Kant),
or poor Guinevere to stand for the Blessed Reformation, or the
Table Round for Liberal Institutions.&nbsp; Mercifully Tennyson
never actually allegorised Arthur in that fashion.&nbsp; Later he
thought of a musical masque of Arthur, and sketched a
<i>scenario</i>.&nbsp; Finally Tennyson dropped both the allegory
of Liberal principles and the musical masque in favour of the
series of heroic idylls.&nbsp; There was only a &ldquo;parabolic
drift&rdquo; in the intention.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no single
fact or incident in the Idylls, however seemingly mystical, which
cannot be explained without any mystery or allegory
whatever.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Idylls ought to be read (and the right
readers never dream of doing anything else) as romantic poems,
just like Browning&rsquo;s <i>Childe Roland</i>, in which the
wrong readers (the members of the Browning Society) sought for
mystic mountains and marvels.&nbsp; Yet Tennyson had his own
interpretation, &ldquo;a dream of man coming into practical life
and ruined by one sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was his
&ldquo;interpretation,&rdquo; or &ldquo;allegory in the
distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People may be heard objecting to the suggestion of any
spiritual interpretation of the Arthur legends, and even to the
existence of elementary morality among the Arthurian knights and
ladies.&nbsp; There seems to be a notion that &ldquo;bold bawdry
and open manslaughter,&rdquo; as Roger Ascham said, are the
staple of Tennyson&rsquo;s sources, whether in the medi&aelig;val
French, the Welsh, or in Malory&rsquo;s compilation, chiefly from
French sources.&nbsp; Tennyson is accused of
&ldquo;Bowdlerising&rdquo; these, and of introducing gentleness,
courtesy, and conscience into a literature where such qualities
were unknown.&nbsp; I must confess myself ignorant of any early
and popular, or &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; literature, in which
human virtues, and the human conscience, do not play their
part.&nbsp; Those who object to Tennyson&rsquo;s handling of the
great Arthurian cycle, on the ground that he is too refined and
too moral, must either never have read or must long have
forgotten even Malory&rsquo;s romance.&nbsp; Thus we read, in a
recent novel, that Lancelot was an <i>homme aux bonnes
fortunes</i>, whereas Lancelot was the most loyal of lovers.</p>
<p>Among other critics, Mr Harrison has objected that the
Arthurian world of Tennyson &ldquo;is not quite an ideal
world.&nbsp; Therein lies the difficulty.&nbsp; The scene, though
not of course historic, has certain historic suggestions and
characters.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not apparent who the historic
characters are, for the real Arthur is but a historic
phantasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;But then, in the midst of so much realism,
the knights, from Arthur downwards, talk and act in ways with
which we are familiar in modern ethical and psychological novels,
but which are as impossible in real medi&aelig;val knights as a
Bengal tiger or a Polar bear would be in a
drawing-room.&rdquo;&nbsp; I confess to little acquaintance with
modern ethical novels; but real medi&aelig;val knights, and still
more the knights of medi&aelig;val romance, were capable of very
ethical actions.&nbsp; To halt an army for the protection and
comfort of a laundress was a highly ethical action.&nbsp; Perhaps
Sir Redvers Buller would do it: Bruce did.&nbsp; Mr Harrison
accuses the ladies of the Idylls of soul-bewildering casuistry,
like that of women in <i>Middlemarch</i> or <i>Helbeck of
Bannisdale</i>.&nbsp; Now I am not reminded by Guinevere, and
Elaine, and Enid, of ladies in these ethical novels.&nbsp; But
the women of the medi&aelig;val <i>Cours d&rsquo;Amour</i> (the
originals from whom the old romancers drew) were nothing if not
casuists.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spiritual delicacy&rdquo; (as they
understood it) was their delight.</p>
<p>Mr Harrison even argues that Malory&rsquo;s men lived
hot-blooded lives in fierce times, &ldquo;before an idea had
arisen in the world of &lsquo;reverencing conscience,&rsquo;
&lsquo;leading sweet lives,&rsquo;&rdquo; and so on.&nbsp; But he
admits that they had &ldquo;fantastic ideals of
&lsquo;honour&rsquo; and &lsquo;love.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; As to
&ldquo;fantastic,&rdquo; that is a matter of opinion, but to have
ideals and to live in accordance with them is to &ldquo;reverence
conscience&rdquo;, which the heroes of the romances are said by
Mr Harrison never to have had an idea of doing.&nbsp; They are
denied even &ldquo;amiable words and courtliness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Need one say that courtliness is the dominant note of
medi&aelig;val knights, in history as in romance?&nbsp; With
discourtesy Froissart would &ldquo;head the count of
crimes.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a battle, he says, Scots knights and
English would thank each other for a good fight, &ldquo;not like
the Germans.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, I dare say,&rdquo; said
Malory&rsquo;s Sir Ector, &ldquo;thou, Sir Lancelot, wast the
curtiest knight that ever bare shield, . . . and thou wast the
meekest man and the gentlest that ever ate in hall among
ladies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Observe Sir Lancelot in the difficult pass
where the Lily Maid offers her love: &ldquo;Jesu defend me, for
then I rewarded your father and your brother full evil for their
great goodness. . . .&nbsp; But because, fair damsel, that ye
love me as ye say ye do, I will, for your good will and kindness,
show you some goodness, . . . and always while I live to be your
true knight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here are &ldquo;amiable words and
courtesy.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot agree with Mr Harrison that
Malory&rsquo;s book is merely &ldquo;a fierce lusty
epic.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was not the opinion of its printer and
publisher, Caxton.&nbsp; He produced it as an example of
&ldquo;the gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights used in
these days, . . . noble and renowned acts of humanity,
gentleness, and chivalry.&nbsp; For herein may be seen noble
chivalry, courtesy, humanity, friendliness, love, cowardice,
murder, hate, virtue, and sin.&nbsp; Do after the good and leave
the evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reaction against the bold-faced heroines and sensual amours
of some of the old French romances, an ideal of exaggerated
asceticism, of stainless chastity, notoriously pervades the
portion of Malory&rsquo;s work which deals with the Holy
Grail.&nbsp; Lancelot is distraught when he finds that, by dint
of enchantment, he has been made false to Guinevere (Book XI.
chap. viii.)&nbsp; After his dreaming vision of the Holy Grail,
with the reproachful Voice, Sir Lancelot said, &ldquo;My sin and
my wickedness have brought me great dishonour, . . . and now I
see and understand that my old sin hindereth and shameth
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was human, the Lancelot of Malory, and
&ldquo;fell to his old love again,&rdquo; with a heavy heart, and
with long penance at the end.&nbsp; How such good knights can be
deemed conscienceless and void of courtesy one knows not, except
by a survival of the Puritanism of Ascham.&nbsp; But Tennyson
found in the book what is in the book&mdash;honour, conscience,
courtesy, and the hero&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whose honour rooted in dishonour stood,<br
/>
And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Malory&rsquo;s book, which was Tennyson&rsquo;s chief source,
ends by being the tragedy of the conscience of Lancelot.&nbsp;
Arthur is dead, or &ldquo;In Avalon he groweth old.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Queen and Lancelot might sing, as Lennox reports that Queen
Mary did after Darnley&rsquo;s murder&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Weel is me</i><br />
<i>For I am free</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why took they not their pastime?&rdquo;&nbsp; Because
conscience forbade, and Guinevere sends her lover far from her,
and both die in religion.&nbsp; Thus Malory&rsquo;s &ldquo;fierce
lusty epic&rdquo; is neither so lusty nor so fierce but that it
gives Tennyson his keynote: the sin that breaks the fair
companionship, and is bitterly repented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The knights are almost too polite to kill each
other,&rdquo; the critic urges.&nbsp; In Malory they are
sometimes quite too polite to kill each other.&nbsp; Sir Darras
has a blood-feud against Sir Tristram, and Sir Tristram is in his
dungeon.&nbsp; Sir Darras said, &ldquo;Wit ye well that Sir
Darras shall never destroy such a noble knight as thou art in
prison, howbeit that thou hast slain three of my sons, whereby I
was greatly aggrieved.&nbsp; But now shalt thou go and thy
fellows. . . .&nbsp; All that ye did,&rdquo; said Sir Darras,
&ldquo;was by force of knighthood, and that was the cause I would
not put you to death&rdquo; (Book IX. chap. xl.)</p>
<p>Tennyson is accused of &ldquo;emasculating the fierce lusty
epic into a moral lesson, as if it were to be performed in a
drawing-room by an academy of young ladies&rdquo;&mdash;presided
over, I daresay, by &ldquo;Anglican clergymen.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
know not how any one who has read the <i>Morte d&rsquo;Arthur</i>
can blame Tennyson in the matter.&nbsp; Let Malory and his
sources be blamed, if to be moral is to be culpable.&nbsp; A few
passages apart, there is no coarseness in Malory; that there are
conscience, courtesy, &ldquo;sweet lives,&rdquo; &ldquo;keeping
down the base in man,&rdquo; &ldquo;amiable words,&rdquo; and all
that Tennyson gives, and, in Mr Harrison&rsquo;s theory, gives
without authority in the romance, my quotations from Malory
demonstrate.&nbsp; They are chosen at a casual opening of his
book.&nbsp; That there &ldquo;had not arisen in the world&rdquo;
&ldquo;the idea of reverencing conscience&rdquo; before the close
of the fifteenth century <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> is an
extraordinary statement for a critic of history to offer.</p>
<p>Mr Harrison makes his protest because &ldquo;in the conspiracy
of silence into which Tennyson&rsquo;s just fame has hypnotised
the critics, it is bare honesty to admit defects.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
think I am not hypnotised, and I do not regard the Idylls as the
crown of Tennyson&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; But it is not his
&ldquo;defect&rdquo; to have introduced generosity, gentleness,
conscience, and chastity where no such things occur in his
sources.&nbsp; Take Sir Darras: his position is that of Priam
when he meets Achilles, who slew his sons, except that Priam
comes as a suppliant; Sir Darras has Tristram in his hands, and
may slay him.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;too polite,&rdquo; as Mr
Harrison says: he is too good a Christian, or too good a
gentleman.&nbsp; One would not have given a tripod for the life
of Achilles had he fallen into the hands of Priam.&nbsp; But
between 1200 <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> (or so) and the
date of Malory, new ideas about &ldquo;living sweet lives&rdquo;
had arisen.&nbsp; Where and when do they not arise?&nbsp; A
British patrol fired on certain Swazis in time of truce.&nbsp;
Their lieutenant, who had been absent when this occurred, rode
alone to the stronghold of the Swazi king, Sekukoeni, and gave
himself up, expecting death by torture.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,
sir,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;we too are
gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of a &ldquo;sweet life&rdquo; of
honour had dawned even on Sekukoeni: it lights up Malory&rsquo;s
romance, and is reflected in Tennyson&rsquo;s Idylls, doubtless
with some modernism of expression.</p>
<p>That the Idylls represent no real world is certain.&nbsp; That
Tennyson modernises and moralises too much, I willingly admit;
what I deny is that he introduces gentleness, courtesy, and
conscience where his sources have none.&nbsp; Indeed this is not
a matter of critical opinion, but of verifiable fact.&nbsp; Any
one can read Malory and judge for himself.&nbsp; But the world in
which the Idylls move could not be real.&nbsp; For more than a
thousand years different races, different ages, had taken hold of
the ancient Celtic legends and spiritualised them after their own
manner, and moulded them to their own ideals.&nbsp; There may
have been a historical Arthur, <i>Comes Britanni&aelig;</i>,
after the Roman withdrawal.&nbsp; <i>Ye Amherawdyr Arthur</i>,
&ldquo;the Emperor Arthur,&rdquo; may have lived and fought, and
led the Brythons to battle.&nbsp; But there may also have been a
Brythonic deity, or culture hero, of the same, or of a similar
name, and myths about him may have been assigned to a real
Arthur.&nbsp; Again, the Arthur of the old Welsh legends was by
no means the blameless king&mdash;even in comparatively late
French romances he is not blameless.&nbsp; But the process of
idealising him went on: still incomplete in Malory&rsquo;s
compilation, where he is often rather otiose and far from
royal.&nbsp; Tennyson, for his purpose, completed the
idealisation.</p>
<p>As to Guinevere, she was not idealised in the old Welsh
rhyme&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Guinevere, Giant Ogurvan&rsquo;s
daughter,<br />
Naughty young, more naughty later.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of Lancelot, and her passion for him, the old Welsh has
nothing to say.&nbsp; Probably Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes, by a
happy blunder or misconception, gave Lancelot his love and his
pre-eminent part.&nbsp; Lancelot was confused with Peredur, and
Guinevere with the lady of whom Peredur was in quest.&nbsp; The
Elaine who becomes by Lancelot the mother of Galahad &ldquo;was
Lancelot&rsquo;s rightful consort, as one recognises in her name
that of Elen, the Empress, whom the story of Peredur&rdquo;
(Lancelot, by the confusion) &ldquo;gives that hero to
wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; The second Elaine, the maid of Astolat, is
another refraction from the original Elen.&nbsp; As to the Grail,
it may be a Christianised rendering of one or another of the
magical and mystic caldrons of Welsh or Irish legend.&nbsp; There
is even an apparent Celtic source of the mysterious fisher king
of the Grail romance. <a name="citation112"></a><a
href="#footnote112" class="citation">[112]</a></p>
<p>A sketch of the evolution of the Arthurian legends might run
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Sixth to eighth century, growth of myth
about an Arthur, real, or supposed to be real.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Tenth century, the Duchies of Normandy and
Brittany are in close relations; by the eleventh century Normans
know Celtic Arthurian stories.</p>
<p class="gutindent">After, 1066, Normans in contact with the
Celtic peoples of this island are in touch with the Arthur
tales.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1130&ndash;1145, works on Arthurian matter
by Geoffrey of Monmouth.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1155, Wace&rsquo;s French translation of
Geoffrey.</p>
<p class="gutindent">1150&ndash;1182, Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes
writes poems on Arthurian topics.</p>
<p class="gutindent">French prose romances on Arthur, from, say,
1180 to 1250.&nbsp; Those romances reach Wales, and modify, in
translations, the original Welsh legends, or, in part, supplant
them.</p>
<p class="gutindent">Amplifications and recastings are
numerous.&nbsp; In 1485 Caxton publishes Malory&rsquo;s
selections from French and English sources, the whole being
Tennyson&rsquo;s main source, <i>Le Mort d&rsquo;Arthur</i>. <a
name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a></p>
<p>Thus the Arthur stories, originally Celtic, originally a mass
of semi-pagan legend, myth, and <i>m&auml;rchen</i>, have been
retold and rehandled by Norman, Englishman, and Frenchman, taking
on new hues, expressing new ideals&mdash;religious, chivalrous,
and moral.&nbsp; Any poet may work his will on them, and
Tennyson&rsquo;s will was to retain the chivalrous courtesy,
generosity, love, and asceticism, while dimly or brightly veiling
or illuminating them with his own ideals.&nbsp; After so many
processes, from folk-tale to modern idyll, the Arthurian world
could not be real, and real it is not.&nbsp; Camelot lies
&ldquo;out of space, out of time,&rdquo; though the colouring is
mainly that of the later chivalry, and &ldquo;the gleam&rdquo; on
the hues is partly derived from Celtic fancy of various dates,
and is partly Tennysonian.</p>
<p>As the Idylls were finally arranged, the first, <i>The Coming
of Arthur</i>, is a remarkable proof of Tennyson&rsquo;s
ingenuity in construction.&nbsp; Tales about the birth of Arthur
varied.&nbsp; In Malory, Uther Pendragon, the Bretwalda (in later
phrase) of Britain, besieges the Duke of Tintagil, who has a fair
wife, Ygerne, in another castle.&nbsp; Merlin magically puts on
Uther the shape of Ygerne&rsquo;s husband, and as her husband she
receives him.&nbsp; On that night Arthur is begotten by Uther,
and the Duke of Tintagil, his mother&rsquo;s husband, is slain in
a sortie.&nbsp; Uther weds Ygerne; both recognise Arthur as their
child.&nbsp; However, by the Celtic custom of fosterage the
infant is intrusted to Sir Ector as his <i>dalt</i>, or
foster-child, and Uther falls in battle.&nbsp; Arthur is later
approven king by the adventure of drawing from the stone the
magic sword that no other king could move.&nbsp; This adventure
answers to Sigmund&rsquo;s drawing the sword from the Branstock,
in the Volsunga Saga, &ldquo;Now men stand up, and none would
fain be the last to lay hand to the sword,&rdquo; apparently
stricken into the pillar by Woden.&nbsp; &ldquo;But none who came
thereto might avail to pull it out, for in nowise would it come
away howsoever they tugged at it, but now up comes Sigmund, King
Volsung&rsquo;s son, and sets hand to the sword, and pulls it
from the stock, even as if it lay loose before him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The incident in the Arthurian as in the Volsunga legend is on a
par with the Golden Bough, in the sixth book of the
<i>&AElig;neid</i>.&nbsp; Only the predestined champion, such as
&AElig;neas, can pluck, or break, or cut the bough&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ipse volens facilisque
sequetu<br />
Si te fata vocant.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this ancient popular element in the Arthur story is
disregarded by Tennyson.&nbsp; He does not make Uther approach
Ygerne in the semblance of her lord, as Zeus approached Alcmena
in the semblance of her husband, Amphitryon.&nbsp; He neglects
the other ancient test of the proving of Arthur by his success in
drawing the sword.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s object is to enfold the
origin and birth of Arthur in a spiritual mystery.&nbsp; This is
deftly accomplished by aid of the various versions of the tale
that reach King Leodogran when Arthur seeks the hand of his
daughter Guinevere, for Arthur&rsquo;s title to the crown is
still disputed, so Leodogran makes inquiries.&nbsp; The answers
first leave it dubious whether Arthur is son of Gorlo&iuml;s,
husband of Ygerne, or of Uther, who slew Gorlo&iuml;s and married
her:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Enforced she was to wed him in her
tears.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Celtic custom of fosterage is overlooked, and Merlin gives
the child to Anton, not as the customary <i>dalt</i>, but to
preserve the babe from danger.&nbsp; Queen Bellicent then tells
Leodogran, from the evidence of Bleys, Merlin&rsquo;s master in
necromancy, the story of Arthur&rsquo;s miraculous advent.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And down the wave and in the flame was
borne<br />
A naked babe, and rode to Merlin&rsquo;s feet,<br />
Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried &lsquo;The King!<br />
Here is an heir for Uther!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Merlin, when asked by Bellicent to corroborate the
statement of Bleys, merely</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Answer&rsquo;d in riddling triplets of old
time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Leodogran&rsquo;s faith is confirmed by a
vision.&nbsp; Thus doubtfully, amidst rumour and portent, cloud
and spiritual light, comes Arthur: &ldquo;from the great
deep&rdquo; he comes, and in as strange fashion, at the end,
&ldquo;to the great deep he goes&rdquo;&mdash;a king to be
accepted in faith or rejected by doubt.&nbsp; Arthur and his
ideal are objects of belief.&nbsp; All goes well while the
knights hold that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The King will follow Christ, and we the
King,<br />
In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In history we find the same situation in the France of
1429&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The King will follow Jeanne, and we the
King.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this faith held, all went well; when the king ceased to
follow, the spell was broken,&mdash;the Maid was martyred.&nbsp;
In this sense the poet conceives the coming of Arthur, a sign to
be spoken against, a test of high purposes, a belief redeeming
and ennobling till faith fails, and the little rift within the
lute, the love of Lancelot and Guinevere, makes discord of the
music.&nbsp; As matter of legend, it is to be understood that
Guinevere did not recognise Arthur when first he rode below her
window&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since he neither wore on helm or shield<br
/>
The golden symbol of his kinglihood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Lancelot was sent to bring the bride&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And return&rsquo;d<br />
Among the flowers, in May, with Guinevere.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then their long love may have begun, as in the story of
Tristram sent to bring Yseult to be the bride of King Mark.&nbsp;
In Malory, however, Lancelot does not come on the scene till
after Arthur&rsquo;s wedding and return from his conquering
expedition to Rome.&nbsp; Then Lancelot wins renown,
&ldquo;wherefore Queen Guinevere had him in favour above all
other knights; and in certain he loved the Queen again above all
other ladies damosels of his life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lancelot, as we
have seen, is practically a French creation, adopted to
illustrate the chivalrous theory of love, with its bitter
fruit.&nbsp; Though not of the original Celtic stock of legend,
Sir Lancelot makes the romance what it is, and draws down the
tragedy that originally turned on the sin of Arthur himself, the
sin that gave birth to the traitor Modred.&nbsp; But the
medi&aelig;val romancers disguised that form of the story, and
the process of idealising Arthur reached such heights in the
middle ages that Tennyson thought himself at liberty to paint the
<i>Flos Regum</i>, &ldquo;the blameless King.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
followed the <i>Brut ab Arthur</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;In short, God
has not made since Adam was, the man more perfect than
Arthur.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is remote from the Arthur of the oldest
Celtic legends, but justifies the poet in adapting Arthur to the
ideal hero of the Idylls:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ideal manhood closed in real man,<br />
Rather than that grey king, whose name, a ghost,<br />
Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain-peak,<br />
And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him<br />
Of Geoffrey&rsquo;s book, or him of Malleor&rsquo;s, one<br />
Touched by the adulterous finger of a time<br />
That hovered between war and wantonness,<br />
And crownings and dethronements.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poetical beauties of <i>The Coming of Arthur</i> excel
those of <i>Gareth and Lynette</i>.&nbsp; The sons of Lot and
Bellicent seem to have been originally regarded as the incestuous
offspring of Arthur and his sister, the wife of King Lot.&nbsp;
Next it was represented that Arthur was ignorant of the
relationship.&nbsp; Mr Rhys supposes that the mythical scandal
(still present in Malory as a sin of ignorance) arose from
blending the Celtic Arthur (as Culture Hero) with an older divine
personage, such as Zeus, who marries his sister Hera.&nbsp;
Marriages of brother and sister are familiar in the Egyptian
royal house, and that of the Incas.&nbsp; But the poet has a
perfect right to disregard a scandalous myth which, obviously
crystallised later about the figure of the mythical Celtic
Arthur, was an incongruous accretion to his legend.&nbsp; Gareth,
therefore, is merely Arthur&rsquo;s nephew, not son, in the poem,
as are Gawain and the traitor Modred.&nbsp; The story seems to be
rather medi&aelig;val French than Celtic&mdash;a mingling of the
spirit of <i>fabliau</i> and popular fairy tale.&nbsp; The poet
has added to its lightness, almost frivolity, the description of
the unreal city of Camelot, built to music, as when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ilion, like a mist, rose into
towers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has also brought in the allegory of Death, which, when
faced, proves to be &ldquo;a blooming boy&rdquo; behind the
mask.&nbsp; The courtesy and prowess of Lancelot lead up to the
later development of his character.</p>
<p>In <i>The Marriage of Geraint</i>, a rumour has already risen
about Lancelot and the Queen, darkening the Court, and
presaging</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s loud whisper breaking
into storm.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this reason Geraint removes Enid from Camelot to his own
land&mdash;the poet thus early leading up to the sin and the doom
of Lancelot.&nbsp; But this motive does not occur in the Welsh
story of Enid and Geraint, which Tennyson has otherwise followed
with unwonted closeness.&nbsp; The tale occurs in French romances
in various forms, but it appears to have returned, by way of
France and coloured with French influences, to Wales, where it is
one of the later Mabinogion.&nbsp; The characters are Celtic, and
Nud, father of Edyrn, Geraint&rsquo;s defeated antagonist,
appears to be recognised by Mr Rhys as &ldquo;the Celtic
Zeus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The manners and the tournaments are
French.&nbsp; In the Welsh tale Geraint and Enid are bedded in
Arthur&rsquo;s own chamber, which seems to be a symbolic
commutation of the <i>jus prim&aelig; noctis</i> a custom of
which the very existence is disputed.&nbsp; This unseemly
antiquarian detail, of course, is omitted in the Idyll.</p>
<p>An abstract of the Welsh tale will show how closely Tennyson
here follows his original.&nbsp; News is brought into
Arthur&rsquo;s Court of the appearance of a white stag.&nbsp; The
king arranges a hunt, and Guinevere asks leave to go and watch
the sport.&nbsp; Next morning she cannot be wakened, though the
tale does not aver, like the Idyll, that she was</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her
love<br />
For Lancelot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guinevere wakes late, and rides through a ford of Usk to the
hunt.&nbsp; Geraint follows, &ldquo;a golden-hilted sword was at
his side, and a robe and a surcoat of satin were upon him, and
two shoes of leather upon his feet, and around him was a scarf of
blue purple, at each corner of which was a golden
apple&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But Guinevere lay late into the morn,<br />
Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love<br />
For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;<br />
But rose at last, a single maiden with her,<br />
Took horse, and forded Usk, and gain&rsquo;d the wood;<br />
There, on a little knoll beside it, stay&rsquo;d<br />
Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead<br />
A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,<br />
Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress<br />
Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,<br />
Came quickly flashing thro&rsquo; the shallow ford<br />
Behind them, and so gallop&rsquo;d up the knoll.<br />
A purple scarf, at either end whereof<br />
There swung an apple of the purest gold,<br />
Sway&rsquo;d round about him, as he gallop&rsquo;d up<br />
To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly<br />
In summer suit and silks of holiday.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The encounter with the dwarf, the lady, and the knight
follows.&nbsp; The prose of the Mabinogi may be compared with the
verse of Tennyson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Geraint,&rdquo; said Gwenhwyvar,
&ldquo;knowest thou the name of that tall knight
yonder?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know him not,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and the strange armour that he wears prevents my either
seeing his face or his features.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,
maiden,&rdquo; said Gwenhwyvar, &ldquo;and ask the dwarf who that
knight is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the maiden went up to the dwarf; and
the dwarf waited for the maiden, when he saw her coming towards
him.&nbsp; And the maiden inquired of the dwarf who the knight
was.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not tell thee,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Since thou art so churlish as not to tell me,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;I will ask him himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou
shalt not ask him, by my faith,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because thou art
not of honour sufficient to befit thee to speak to my
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the maiden turned her horse&rsquo;s head
towards the knight, upon which the dwarf struck her with the whip
that was in his hand across the face and the eyes, until the
blood flowed forth.&nbsp; And the maiden, through the hurt she
received from the blow, returned to Gwenhwyvar, complaining of
the pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very rudely has the dwarf treated
thee,&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will go myself to know
who the knight is.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said
Gwenhwyvar.&nbsp; And Geraint went up to the dwarf.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who is yonder knight?&rdquo; said Geraint.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will not tell thee,&rdquo; said the dwarf.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then will
I ask him himself,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;That wilt thou
not, by my faith,&rdquo; said the dwarf; &ldquo;thou art not
honourable enough to speak with my Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said
Geraint, &ldquo;I have spoken with men of equal rank with
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned his horse&rsquo;s head towards
the knight; but the dwarf overtook him, and struck him as he had
done the maiden, so that the blood coloured the scarf that
Geraint wore.&nbsp; Then Geraint put his hand upon the hilt of
his sword, but he took counsel with himself, and considered that
it would be no vengeance for him to slay the dwarf, and to be
attacked unarmed by the armed knight, so he returned to where
Gwenhwyvar was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And while they listen&rsquo;d for the
distant hunt,<br />
And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,<br />
King Arthur&rsquo;s hound of deepest mouth, there rode<br />
Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;<br />
Whereof the dwarf lagg&rsquo;d latest, and the knight<br />
Had vizor up, and show&rsquo;d a youthful face,<br />
Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.<br />
And Guinevere, not mindful of his face<br />
In the King&rsquo;s hall, desired his name, and sent<br />
Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;<br />
Who being vicious, old and irritable,<br />
And doubling all his master&rsquo;s vice of pride,<br />
Made answer sharply that she should not know.<br />
&lsquo;Then will I ask it of himself,&rsquo; she said.<br />
&lsquo;Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,&rsquo; cried the
dwarf;<br />
&lsquo;Thou art not worthy ev&rsquo;n to speak of him&rsquo;;<br
/>
And when she put her horse toward the knight,<br />
Struck at her with his whip, and she return&rsquo;d<br />
Indignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint<br />
Exclaiming, &lsquo;Surely I will learn the name,&rsquo;<br />
Made sharply to the dwarf, and ask&rsquo;d it of him,<br />
Who answer&rsquo;d as before; and when the Prince<br />
Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,<br />
Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.<br />
The Prince&rsquo;s blood spirted upon the scarf,<br />
Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand<br />
Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:<br />
But he, from his exceeding manfulness<br />
And pure nobility of temperament,<br />
Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrain&rsquo;d<br />
From ev&rsquo;n a word.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The self-restraint of Geraint, who does not slay the
dwarf,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;From his exceeding
manfulness<br />
And pure nobility of temperament,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>may appear &ldquo;too polite,&rdquo; and too much in accord
with the still undiscovered idea of &ldquo;leading sweet
lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, the uninvented idea does occur in
the Welsh original: &ldquo;Then Geraint put his hand upon the
hilt of his sword, but he took counsel with himself, and
considered that it would be no vengeance for him to slay the
dwarf,&rdquo; while he also reflects that he would be
&ldquo;attacked unarmed by the armed knight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps
Tennyson may be blamed for omitting this obvious motive for
self-restraint.&nbsp; Geraint therefore follows the knight in
hope of finding arms, and arrives at the town all busy with
preparations for the tournament of the sparrow-hawk.&nbsp; This
was a challenge sparrow-hawk: the knight had won it twice, and if
he won it thrice it would be his to keep.&nbsp; The rest, in the
tale, is exactly followed in the Idyll.&nbsp; Geraint is
entertained by the ruined Yniol.&nbsp; The youth bears the
&ldquo;costrel&rdquo; full of &ldquo;good purchased mead&rdquo;
(the ruined Earl not brewing for himself), and Enid carries the
manchet bread in her veil, &ldquo;old, and beginning to be worn
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; All Tennyson&rsquo;s own is the beautiful
passage&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And while he waited in
the castle court,<br />
The voice of Enid, Yniol&rsquo;s daughter, rang<br />
Clear thro&rsquo; the open casement of the hall,<br />
Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,<br />
Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,<br />
Moves him to think what kind of bird it is<br />
That sings so delicately clear, and make<br />
Conjecture of the plumage and the form;<br />
So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;<br />
And made him like a man abroad at morn<br />
When first the liquid note beloved of men<br />
Comes flying over many a windy wave<br />
To Britain, and in April suddenly<br />
Breaks from a coppice gemm&rsquo;d with green and red,<br />
And he suspends his converse with a friend,<br />
Or it may be the labour of his hands,<br />
To think or say, &lsquo;There is the nightingale&rsquo;;<br />
So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,<br />
&lsquo;Here, by God&rsquo;s grace, is the one voice for
me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yniol frankly admits in the tale that he was in the wrong in
the quarrel with his nephew.&nbsp; The poet, however, gives him
the right, as is natural.&nbsp; The combat is exactly followed in
the Idyll, as is Geraint&rsquo;s insistence in carrying his bride
to Court in her faded silks.&nbsp; Geraint, however, leaves Court
with Enid, not because of the scandal about Lancelot, but to do
his duty in his own country.&nbsp; He becomes indolent and
uxorious, and Enid deplores his weakness, and awakes his
suspicions, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And one morning in the summer time they were upon
their couch, and Geraint lay upon the edge of it.&nbsp; And Enid
was without sleep in the apartment which had windows of
glass.&nbsp; And the sun shone upon the couch.&nbsp; And the
clothes had slipped from off his arms and his breast, and he was
asleep.&nbsp; Then she gazed upon the marvellous beauty of his
appearance, and she said, &ldquo;Alas, and am I the cause that
these arms and this breast have lost their glory and the warlike
fame which they once so richly enjoyed!&rdquo;&nbsp; And as she
said this, the tears dropped from her eyes, and they fell upon
his breast.&nbsp; And the tears she shed, and the words she had
spoken, awoke him; and another thing contributed to awaken him,
and that was the idea that it was not in thinking of him that she
spoke thus, but that it was because she loved some other man more
than him, and that she wished for other society, and thereupon
Geraint was troubled in his mind, and he called his squire; and
when he came to him, &ldquo;Go quickly,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and prepare my horse and my arms, and make them
ready.&nbsp; And do thou arise,&rdquo; said he to Enid,
&ldquo;and apparel thyself; and cause thy horse to be accoutred,
and clothe thee in the worst riding-dress that thou hast in thy
possession.&nbsp; And evil betide me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if
thou returnest here until thou knowest whether I have lost my
strength so completely as thou didst say.&nbsp; And if it be so,
it will then be easy for thee to seek the society thou didst wish
for of him of whom thou wast thinking.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she arose,
and clothed herself in her meanest garments.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
nothing, Lord,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;of thy
meaning.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither wilt thou know at this
time,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At last, it chanced that on a summer
morn<br />
(They sleeping each by either) the new sun<br />
Beat thro&rsquo; the blindless casement of the room,<br />
And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;<br />
Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,<br />
And bared the knotted column of his throat,<br />
The massive square of his heroic breast,<br />
And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,<br />
As slopes a wild brook o&rsquo;er a little stone,<br />
Running too vehemently to break upon it.<br />
And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,<br />
Admiring him, and thought within herself,<br />
Was ever man so grandly made as he?<br />
Then, like a shadow, past the people&rsquo;s talk<br />
And accusation of uxoriousness<br />
Across her mind, and bowing over him,<br />
Low to her own heart piteously she said:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;O noble breast and all-puissant
arms,<br />
Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men<br />
Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?<br />
I <i>am</i> the cause, because I dare not speak<br />
And tell him what I think and what they say.<br />
And yet I hate that he should linger here;<br />
I cannot love my lord and not his name.<br />
Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,<br />
And ride with him to battle and stand by,<br />
And watch his mightful hand striking great blows<br />
At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.<br />
Far better were I laid in the dark earth,<br />
Not hearing any more his noble voice,<br />
Not to be folded more in these dear arms,<br />
And darken&rsquo;d from the high light in his eyes,<br />
Than that my lord thro&rsquo; me should suffer shame.<br />
Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,<br />
And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,<br />
Or maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,<br />
And yet not dare to tell him what I think,<br />
And how men slur him, saying all his force<br />
Is melted into mere effeminacy?<br />
O me, I fear that I am no true wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,<br />
And the strong passion in her made her weep<br />
True tears upon his broad and naked breast,<br />
And these awoke him, and by great mischance<br />
He heard but fragments of her later words,<br />
And that she fear&rsquo;d she was not a true wife.<br />
And then he thought, &lsquo;In spite of all my care,<br />
For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,<br />
She is not faithful to me, and I see her<br />
Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur&rsquo;s hall.&rsquo;<br />
Then tho&rsquo; he loved and reverenced her too much<br />
To dream she could be guilty of foul act,<br />
Right thro&rsquo; his manful breast darted the pang<br />
That makes a man, in the sweet face of her<br />
Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable.<br />
At this he hurl&rsquo;d his huge limbs out of bed,<br />
And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,<br />
&lsquo;My charger and her palfrey&rsquo;; then to her,<br />
&lsquo;I will ride forth into the wilderness;<br />
For tho&rsquo; it seems my spurs are yet to win,<br />
I have not fall&rsquo;n so low as some would wish.<br />
And thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress<br />
And ride with me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Enid ask&rsquo;d, amazed,<br
/>
&lsquo;If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.&rsquo;<br />
But he, &lsquo;I charge thee, ask not, but obey.&rsquo;<br />
Then she bethought her of a faded silk,<br />
A faded mantle and a faded veil,<br />
And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,<br />
Wherein she kept them folded reverently<br />
With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,<br />
She took them, and array&rsquo;d herself therein,<br />
Remembering when first he came on her<br />
Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,<br />
And all her foolish fears about the dress,<br />
And all his journey to her, as himself<br />
Had told her, and their coming to the court.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tennyson&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Arms on which the standing muscle
sloped,<br />
As slopes a wild brook o&rsquo;er a little stone,<br />
Running too vehemently to break upon it,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is suggested perhaps by Theocritus&mdash;&ldquo;The muscles on
his brawny arms stood out like rounded rocks that the winter
torrent has rolled and worn smooth, in the great swirling
stream&rdquo; (Idyll xxii.)</p>
<p>The second part of the poem follows the original less
closely.&nbsp; Thus Limours, in the tale, is not an old suitor of
Enid; Edyrn does not appear to the rescue; certain cruel games,
veiled in a magic mist, occur in the tale, and are omitted by the
poet; &ldquo;Gwyffert petit, so called by the Franks, whom the
Cymry call the Little King,&rdquo; in the tale, is not a
character in the Idyll, and, generally, the gross Celtic
exaggerations of Geraint&rsquo;s feats are toned down by
Tennyson.&nbsp; In other respects, as when Geraint eats the
mowers&rsquo; dinner, the tale supplies the materials.&nbsp; But
it does not dwell tenderly on the reconciliation.&nbsp; The tale
is more or less in the vein of &ldquo;patient Grizel,&rdquo; and
he who told it is more concerned with the fighting than with
<i>amoris redintegratio</i>, and the sufferings of Enid.&nbsp;
The Idyll is enriched with many beautiful pictures from nature,
such as this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But at the flash and motion of the man<br
/>
They vanish&rsquo;d panic-stricken, like a shoal<br />
Of darting fish, that on a summer morn<br />
Adown the crystal dykes at Camelot<br />
Come slipping o&rsquo;er their shadows on the sand,<br />
But if a man who stands upon the brink<br />
But lift a shining hand against the sun,<br />
There is not left the twinkle of a fin<br />
Betwixt the cressy islets white in flower;<br />
So, scared but at the motion of the man,<br />
Fled all the boon companions of the Earl,<br />
And left him lying in the public way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>Balin and Balan</i> Tennyson displays great constructive
power, and remarkable skill in moulding the most recalcitrant
materials.&nbsp; Balin or Balyn, according to Mr Rhys, is the
Belinus of Geoffrey of Monmouth, &ldquo;whose name represents the
Celtic divinity described in Latin as Apollo Belenus or
Belinus.&rdquo; <a name="citation129a"></a><a
href="#footnote129a" class="citation">[129a]</a>&nbsp; In
Geoffrey, Belinus, euphemerised, or reduced from god to hero, has
a brother, Brennius, the Celtic Br&acirc;n, King of Britain from
Caithness to the Humber.&nbsp; Belinus drives Br&acirc;n into
exile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus it is seen that Belinus or Balyn was,
mythologically speaking, the natural enemy&rdquo; (as Apollo
Belinus, the radiant god) &ldquo;of the dark divinity Br&acirc;n
or Balan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this view be correct, the two brothers answer to the good
and bad principles of myths like that of the Huron Iouskeha the
Sun, and Anatensic the Moon, or rather Taouiscara and Iouskeha,
the hostile brothers, Black and White. <a
name="citation129b"></a><a href="#footnote129b"
class="citation">[129b]</a>&nbsp; These mythical brethren are, in
Malory, two knights of Northumberland, Balin the wild and
Balan.&nbsp; Their adventures are mixed up with a hostile Lady of
the Lake, whom Balin slays in Arthur&rsquo;s presence, with a
sword which none but Balin can draw from sheath; and with an evil
black-faced knight Garlon, invisible at will, whom Balin slays in
the castle of the knight&rsquo;s brother, King Pellam.&nbsp;
Pursued from room to room by Pellam, Balin finds himself in a
chamber full of relics of Joseph of Arimathea.&nbsp; There he
seizes a spear, the very spear with which the Roman soldier
pierced the side of the Crucified, and wounds Pellam.&nbsp; The
castle falls in ruins &ldquo;through that dolorous
stroke.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pellam becomes the maimed king, who can only
be healed by the Holy Grail.&nbsp; Apparently Celtic myths of
obscure antiquity have been adapted in France, and interwoven
with fables about Joseph of Arimathea and Christian
mysteries.&nbsp; It is not possible here to go into the
complicated learning of the subject.&nbsp; In Malory, Balin,
after dealing the dolorous stroke, borrows a strange shield from
a knight, and, thus accoutred, meets his brother Balan, who does
not recognise him.&nbsp; They fight, both die and are buried in
one tomb, and Galahad later achieves the adventure of winning
Balin&rsquo;s sword.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus endeth the tale of Balyn
and of Balan, two brethren born in Northumberland, good
knights,&rdquo; says Malory, simply, and unconscious of the
strange mythological medley under the coat armour of romance.</p>
<p>The materials, then, seemed confused and obdurate, but
Tennyson works them into the course of the fatal love of Lancelot
and Guinevere, and into the spiritual texture of the
Idylls.&nbsp; Balin has been expelled from Court for the wildness
that gives him his name, <i>Balin le Sauvage</i>.&nbsp; He had
buffeted a squire in hall.&nbsp; He and Balan await all
challengers beside a well.&nbsp; Arthur encounters and dismounts
them.&nbsp; Balin devotes himself to self-conquest.&nbsp; Then
comes tidings that Pellam, of old leagued with Lot against
Arthur, has taken to religion, collects relics, claims descent
from Joseph of Arimathea, and owns the sacred spear that pierced
the side of Christ.&nbsp; But Garlon is with him, the knight
invisible, who appears to come from an Irish source, or at least
has a parallel in Irish legend.&nbsp; This Garlon has an
unknightly way of killing men by viewless blows from the
rear.&nbsp; Balan goes to encounter Garlon.&nbsp; Balin remains,
learning courtesy, modelling himself on Lancelot, and gaining
leave to bear Guinevere&rsquo;s Crown Matrimonial for his
cognisance,&mdash;which, of course, Balan does not
know,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As golden earnest of a better
life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Balin sees reason to think that Lancelot and Guinevere
love even too well.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Then chanced, one
morning, that Sir Balin sat<br />
Close-bower&rsquo;d in that garden nigh the hall.<br />
A walk of roses ran from door to door;<br />
A walk of lilies crost it to the bower:<br />
And down that range of roses the great Queen<br />
Came with slow steps, the morning on her face;<br />
And all in shadow from the counter door<br />
Sir Lancelot as to meet her, then at once,<br />
As if he saw not, glanced aside, and paced<br />
The long white walk of lilies toward the bower.<br />
Follow&rsquo;d the Queen; Sir Balin heard her &lsquo;Prince,<br
/>
Art thou so little loyal to thy Queen,<br />
As pass without good morrow to thy Queen?&rsquo;<br />
To whom Sir Lancelot with his eyes on earth,<br />
&lsquo;Fain would I still be loyal to the Queen.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Yea so,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but so to pass me
by&mdash;<br />
So loyal scarce is loyal to thyself,<br />
Whom all men rate the king of courtesy.<br />
Let be: ye stand, fair lord, as in a dream.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Lancelot with his hand among the
flowers,<br />
&lsquo;Yea&mdash;for a dream.&nbsp; Last night methought I saw<br
/>
That maiden Saint who stands with lily in hand<br />
In yonder shrine.&nbsp; All round her prest the dark,<br />
And all the light upon her silver face<br />
Flow&rsquo;d from the spiritual lily that she held.<br />
Lo! these her emblems drew mine eyes&mdash;away:<br />
For see, how perfect-pure!&nbsp; As light a flush<br />
As hardly tints the blossom of the quince<br />
Would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Sweeter to me,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;this garden rose<br />
Deep-hued and many-folded sweeter still<br />
The wild-wood hyacinth and the bloom of May.<br />
Prince, we have ridd&rsquo;n before among the flowers<br />
In those fair days&mdash;not all as cool as these,<br />
Tho&rsquo; season-earlier.&nbsp; Art thou sad? or sick?<br />
Our noble King will send thee his own leech&mdash;<br />
Sick? or for any matter anger&rsquo;d at me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Lancelot lifted his large eyes; they
dwelt<br />
Deep-tranced on hers, and could not fall: her hue<br />
Changed at his gaze: so turning side by side<br />
They past, and Balin started from his bower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Queen? subject? but I see not what I
see.<br />
Damsel and lover? hear not what I hear.<br />
My father hath begotten me in his wrath.<br />
I suffer from the things before me, know,<br />
Learn nothing; am not worthy to be knight;<br />
A churl, a clown!&rsquo; and in him gloom on gloom<br />
Deepen&rsquo;d: he sharply caught his lance and shield,<br />
Nor stay&rsquo;d to crave permission of the King,<br />
But, mad for strange adventure, dash&rsquo;d away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Balin is &ldquo;disillusioned,&rdquo; his faith in the Ideal
is shaken if not shattered.&nbsp; He rides at adventure.&nbsp;
Arriving at the half-ruined castle of Pellam, that dubious
devotee, he hears Garlon insult Guinevere, but restrains
himself.&nbsp; Next day, again insulted for bearing &ldquo;the
crown scandalous&rdquo; on his shield, he strikes Garlon down, is
pursued, seizes the sacred spear, and escapes.&nbsp; Vivien meets
him in the woods, drops scandal in his ears, and so maddens him
that he defaces his shield with the crown of Guinevere.&nbsp; Her
song, and her words,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This
fire of Heaven,<br />
This old sun-worship, boy, will rise again,<br />
And beat the cross to earth, and break the King<br />
And all his Table,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>might be forced into an allegory of the revived pride of life,
at the Renaissance and after.&nbsp; The maddened yells of Balin
strike the ear of Balan, who thinks he has met the foul knight
Garlon, that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tramples on the goodly shield to show<br />
His loathing of our Order and the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They fight, fatally wound, and finally recognise each other:
Balan trying to restore Balin&rsquo;s faith in Guinevere, who is
merely slandered by Garlon and Vivien.&nbsp; Balin acknowledges
that his wildness has been their common bane, and they die,
&ldquo;either locked in either&rsquo;s arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is nothing in Malory, nor in any other source, so far as
I am aware, which suggested to Tennyson the <i>clou</i> of the
situation&mdash;the use of Guinevere&rsquo;s crown as a
cognisance by Balin.&nbsp; This device enables the poet to weave
the rather confused and unintelligible adventures of Balin and
Balan into the scheme, and to make it a stage in the progress of
his fable.&nbsp; That Balin was reckless and wild Malory bears
witness, but his endeavours to conquer himself and reach the
ideal set by Lancelot are Tennyson&rsquo;s addition, with all the
tragedy of Balin&rsquo;s disenchantment and despair.&nbsp; The
strange fantastic house of Pellam, full of the most sacred
things,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In which he scarce could spy the Christ for
Saints,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yet sheltering the human fiend Garlon, is supplied by Malory,
whose predecessors probably blended more than one myth of the old
Cymry into the romance, washed over with Christian
colouring.&nbsp; As Malory tells this part of the tale it is
perhaps more strange and effective than in the Idyll.&nbsp; The
introduction of Vivien into this adventure is wholly due to
Tennyson: her appearance here leads up to her triumph in the poem
which follows, <i>Merlin and Vivien</i>.</p>
<p>The nature and origin of Merlin are something of a
mystery.&nbsp; Hints and rumours of Merlin, as of Arthur, stream
from hill and grave as far north as Tweedside.&nbsp; If he was a
historical person, myths of magic might crystallise round him, as
round Virgil in Italy.&nbsp; The process would be the easier in a
country where the practices of Druidry still lingered, and
revived after the retreat of the Romans.&nbsp; The medi&aelig;val
romancers invented a legend that Merlin was a virgin-born child
of Satan.&nbsp; In Tennyson he may be guessed to represent the
fabled esoteric lore of old religions, with their vague
pantheisms, and such magic as the <i>tapas</i> of Brahmanic
legends.&nbsp; He is wise with a riddling evasive wisdom: the
builder of Camelot, the prophet, a shadow of Druidry clinging to
the Christian king.&nbsp; His wisdom cannot avail him: if he
beholds &ldquo;his own mischance with a glassy
countenance,&rdquo; he cannot avoid his shapen fate.&nbsp; He
becomes assotted of Vivien, and goes open-eyed to his doom.</p>
<p>The enchantress, Vivien, is one of that dubious company of
Ladies of the Lake, now friendly, now treacherous.&nbsp; Probably
these ladies are the fairies of popular Celtic tradition, taken
up into the more elaborate poetry of Cymric literature and
medi&aelig;val romance.&nbsp; Mr Rhys traces Vivien, or Nimue, or
Nyneue, back, through a series of pal&aelig;ographic changes and
errors, to Rhiannon, wife of Pwyll, a kind of lady of the lake he
thinks, but the identification is not very satisfactory.&nbsp;
Vivien is certainly &ldquo;one of the damsels of the lake&rdquo;
in Malory, and the damsels of the lake seem to be lake fairies,
with all their beguilements and strange unstable loves.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And always Merlin lay about the lady to have her
maidenhood, and she was ever passing weary of him, and fain would
have been delivered of him, for she was afraid of him because he
was a devil&rsquo;s son. . . .&nbsp; So by her subtle working she
made Merlin to go under that stone to let her wit of the marvels
there, but she wrought so there for him that he came never out
for all the craft he could do.&nbsp; And so she departed and left
Merlin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sympathy of Malory is not with the
enchanter.&nbsp; In the Idylls, as finally published, Vivien is
born on a battlefield of death, with a nature perverted, and an
instinctive hatred of the good.&nbsp; Wherefore she leaves the
Court of King Mark to make mischief in Camelot.&nbsp; She is, in
fact, the ideal minx, a character not elsewhere treated by
Tennyson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She hated all the
knights, and heard in thought<br />
Their lavish comment when her name was named.<br />
For once, when Arthur walking all alone,<br />
Vext at a rumour issued from herself<br />
Of some corruption crept among his knights,<br />
Had met her, Vivien, being greeted fair,<br />
Would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood<br />
With reverent eyes mock-loyal, shaken voice,<br />
And flutter&rsquo;d adoration, and at last<br />
With dark sweet hints of some who prized him more<br />
Than who should prize him most; at which the King<br />
Had gazed upon her blankly and gone by:<br />
But one had watch&rsquo;d, and had not held his peace:<br />
It made the laughter of an afternoon<br />
That Vivien should attempt the blameless King.<br />
And after that, she set herself to gain<br />
Him, the most famous man of all those times,<br />
Merlin, who knew the range of all their arts,<br />
Had built the King his havens, ships, and halls,<br />
Was also Bard, and knew the starry heavens;<br />
The people call&rsquo;d him Wizard; whom at first<br />
She play&rsquo;d about with slight and sprightly talk,<br />
And vivid smiles, and faintly-venom&rsquo;d points<br />
Of slander, glancing here and grazing there;<br />
And yielding to his kindlier moods, the Seer<br />
Would watch her at her petulance, and play,<br />
Ev&rsquo;n when they seem&rsquo;d unloveable, and laugh<br />
As those that watch a kitten; thus he grew<br />
Tolerant of what he half disdain&rsquo;d, and she,<br />
Perceiving that she was but half disdain&rsquo;d,<br />
Began to break her sports with graver fits,<br />
Turn red or pale, would often when they met<br />
Sigh fully, or all-silent gaze upon him<br />
With such a fixt devotion, that the old man,<br />
Tho&rsquo; doubtful, felt the flattery, and at times<br />
Would flatter his own wish in age for love,<br />
And half believe her true: for thus at times<br />
He waver&rsquo;d; but that other clung to him,<br />
Fixt in her will, and so the seasons went.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vivien is modern enough&mdash;if any type of character is
modern: at all events there is no such Blanche Amory of a girl in
the old legends and romances.&nbsp; In these Merlin fatigues the
lady by his love; she learns his arts, and gets rid of him as she
can.&nbsp; His forebodings in the Idyll contain a magnificent
image:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There lay she all her
length and kiss&rsquo;d his feet,<br />
As if in deepest reverence and in love.<br />
A twist of gold was round her hair; a robe<br />
Of samite without price, that more exprest<br />
Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs,<br />
In colour like the satin-shining palm<br />
On sallows in the windy gleams of March:<br />
And while she kiss&rsquo;d them, crying, &lsquo;Trample me,<br />
Dear feet, that I have follow&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the world,<br
/>
And I will pay you worship; tread me down<br />
And I will kiss you for it&rsquo;; he was mute:<br />
So dark a forethought roll&rsquo;d about his brain,<br />
As on a dull day in an Ocean cave<br />
The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall<br />
In silence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think of the blinded Cyclops groping round his cave, like
&ldquo;the blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The richness, the many shining contrasts and immortal lines in
<i>Vivien</i>, seem almost too noble for a subject not easily
redeemed, and the picture of the ideal Court lying in full
corruption.&nbsp; Next to <i>Elaine</i>, Jowett wrote that he
&ldquo;admired <i>Vivien</i> the most (the naughty one), which
seems to me a work of wonderful power and skill.&nbsp; It is most
elegant and fanciful.&nbsp; I am not surprised at your Delilah
beguiling the wise man; she is quite equal to it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The dramatic versatility of Tennyson&rsquo;s genius, his power of
creating the most various characters, is nowhere better displayed
than in the contrast between the <i>Vivien</i> and the
<i>Elaine</i>.&nbsp; Vivien is a type, her adventure is of a
nature, which he has not elsewhere handled.&nbsp; Thackeray, who
admired the Idylls so enthusiastically, might have recognised in
Vivien a character not unlike some of his own, as dark as Becky
Sharp, more terrible in her selfishness than that Beatrix Esmond
who is still a paragon, and, in her creator&rsquo;s despite, a
queen of hearts.&nbsp; In Elaine, on the other hand, Tennyson has
drawn a girl so innocently passionate, and told a tale of love
that never found his earthly close, so delicately beautiful, that
we may perhaps place this Idyll the highest of his poems on love,
and reckon it the gem of the Idylls, the central diamond in the
diamond crown.&nbsp; Reading <i>Elaine</i> once more, after an
interval of years, one is captivated by its grace, its pathos,
its nobility.&nbsp; The poet had touched on some unidentified
form of the story, long before, in <i>The Lady of
Shalott</i>.&nbsp; That poem had the mystery of romance, but, in
human interest, could not compete with <i>Elaine</i>, if indeed
any poem of Tennyson&rsquo;s can be ranked with this matchless
Idyll.</p>
<p>The mere invention, and, as we may say, <i>charpentage</i>,
are of the first order.&nbsp; The materials in Malory, though
beautiful, are simple, and left a field for the poet&rsquo;s
invention. <a name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139"

<p>Arthur, with the Scots and Northern knights, means to
encounter all comers at a Whitsuntide tourney.&nbsp; Guinevere is
ill, and cannot go to the jousts, while Lancelot makes excuse
that he is not healed of a wound.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore the King
was heavy and passing wroth, and so he departed towards
Winchester.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Queen then blamed Lancelot: people
will say they deceive Arthur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said
Sir Lancelot, &ldquo;I allow your wit; it is of late come that ye
were wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the Idyll Guinevere speaks as if their
early loves had been as conspicuous as, according to George
Buchanan, were those of Queen Mary and Bothwell.&nbsp; Lancelot
will go to the tourney, and, despite Guinevere&rsquo;s warning,
will take part against Arthur and his own fierce Northern
kinsmen.&nbsp; He rides to Astolat&mdash;&ldquo;that is,
Gylford&rdquo;&mdash;where Arthur sees him.&nbsp; He borrows the
blank shield of &ldquo;Sir Torre,&rdquo; and the company of his
brother Sir Lavaine.&nbsp; Elaine &ldquo;cast such a love unto
Sir Lancelot that she would never withdraw her love, wherefore
she died.&rdquo;&nbsp; At her prayer, and for better disguise (as
he had never worn a lady&rsquo;s favour), Lancelot carried her
scarlet pearl-embroidered sleeve in his helmet, and left his
shield in Elaine&rsquo;s keeping.&nbsp; The tourney passes as in
the poem, Gawain recognising Lancelot, but puzzled by the favour
he wears.&nbsp; The wounded Lancelot &ldquo;thought to do what he
might while he might endure.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he is offered the
prize he is so sore hurt that he &ldquo;takes no force of no
honour.&rdquo;&nbsp; He rides into a wood, where Lavaine draws
forth the spear.&nbsp; Lavaine brings Lancelot to the hermit,
once a knight.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have seen the day,&rdquo; says the
hermit, &ldquo;I would have loved him the worse, because he was
against my lord, King Arthur, for some time.&nbsp; I was one of
the fellowship of the Round Table, but I thank God now I am
otherwise disposed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gawain, seeking the wounded
knight, comes to Astolat, where Elaine declares &ldquo;he is the
man in the world that I first loved, and truly he is the last
that ever I shall love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gawain, on seeing the
shield, tells Elaine that the wounded knight is Lancelot, and she
goes to seek him and Lavaine.&nbsp; Gawain does not pay court to
Elaine, nor does Arthur rebuke him, as in the poem.&nbsp; When
Guinevere heard that Lancelot bore another lady&rsquo;s favour,
&ldquo;she was nigh out of her mind for wrath,&rdquo; and
expressed her anger to Sir Bors, for Gawain had spoken of the
maid of Astolat.&nbsp; Bors tells this to Lancelot, who is tended
by Elaine.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;But I well see,&rsquo; said Sir
Bors, &lsquo;by her diligence about you that she loveth you
entirely.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That me repenteth,&rsquo; said Sir
Lancelot.&nbsp; Said Sir Bors, &lsquo;Sir, she is not the first
that hath lost her pain upon you, and that is the more
pity.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; When Lancelot recovers, and returns to
Astolat, she declares her love with the frankness of ladies in
medi&aelig;val romance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have mercy upon me and
suffer me not to die for thy love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lancelot replies
with the courtesy and the offers of service which became
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of all this,&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;I
will none; for but if ye will wed me, or be my paramour at the
least, wit you well, Sir Lancelot, my good days are
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a difficult pass for the poet, living in other days
of other manners.&nbsp; His art appears in the turn which he
gives to Elaine&rsquo;s declaration:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But when Sir
Lancelot&rsquo;s deadly hurt was whole,<br />
To Astolat returning rode the three.<br />
There morn by morn, arraying her sweet self<br />
In that wherein she deem&rsquo;d she look&rsquo;d her best,<br />
She came before Sir Lancelot, for she thought<br />
&lsquo;If I be loved, these are my festal robes,<br />
If not, the victim&rsquo;s flowers before he fall.&rsquo;<br />
And Lancelot ever prest upon the maid<br />
That she should ask some goodly gift of him<br />
For her own self or hers; &lsquo;and do not shun<br />
To speak the wish most near to your true heart;<br />
Such service have ye done me, that I make<br />
My will of yours, and Prince and Lord am I<br />
In mine own land, and what I will I can.&rsquo;<br />
Then like a ghost she lifted up her face,<br />
But like a ghost without the power to speak.<br />
And Lancelot saw that she withheld her wish,<br />
And bode among them yet a little space<br />
Till he should learn it; and one morn it chanced<br />
He found her in among the garden yews,<br />
And said, &lsquo;Delay no longer, speak your wish,<br />
Seeing I go to-day&rsquo;: then out she brake:<br />
&lsquo;Going? and we shall never see you more.<br />
And I must die for want of one bold word.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Speak: that I live to hear,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is
yours.&rsquo;<br />
Then suddenly and passionately she spoke:<br />
&lsquo;I have gone mad.&nbsp; I love you: let me die.&rsquo;<br
/>
&lsquo;Ah, sister,&rsquo; answer&rsquo;d Lancelot, &lsquo;what is
this?&rsquo;<br />
And innocently extending her white arms,<br />
&lsquo;Your love,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;your love&mdash;to be
your wife.&rsquo;<br />
And Lancelot answer&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Had I chosen to wed,<br />
I had been wedded earlier, sweet Elaine:<br />
But now there never will be wife of mine.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;No, no&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I care not to be wife,<br
/>
But to be with you still, to see your face,<br />
To serve you, and to follow you thro&rsquo; the world.&rsquo;<br
/>
And Lancelot answer&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Nay, the world, the world,<br
/>
All ear and eye, with such a stupid heart<br />
To interpret ear and eye, and such a tongue<br />
To blare its own interpretation&mdash;nay,<br />
Full ill then should I quit your brother&rsquo;s love,<br />
And your good father&rsquo;s kindness.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she
said,<br />
&lsquo;Not to be with you, not to see your face&mdash;<br />
Alas for me then, my good days are done.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So she dies, and is borne down Thames to London, the fairest
corpse, &ldquo;and she lay as though she had smiled.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Her letter is read.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye might have showed her,&rdquo;
said the Queen, &ldquo;some courtesy and gentleness that might
have preserved her life;&rdquo; and so the two are
reconciled.</p>
<p>Such, in brief, is the tender old tale of true love, with the
shining courtesy of Lavaine and the father of the maid, who speak
no word of anger against Lancelot.&nbsp; &ldquo;For since first I
saw my lord, Sir Lancelot,&rdquo; says Lavaine, &ldquo;I could
never depart from him, nor nought I will, if I may follow him:
she doth as I do.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the simple and moving story
Tennyson adds, by way of ornament, the diamonds, the prize of the
tourney, and the manner of their finding:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For Arthur, long before
they crown&rsquo;d him King,<br />
Roving the trackless realms of Lyonnesse,<br />
Had found a glen, gray boulder and black tarn.<br />
A horror lived about the tarn, and clave<br />
Like its own mists to all the mountain side:<br />
For here two brothers, one a king, had met<br />
And fought together; but their names were lost;<br />
And each had slain his brother at a blow;<br />
And down they fell and made the glen abhorr&rsquo;d:<br />
And there they lay till all their bones were bleach&rsquo;d,<br
/>
And lichen&rsquo;d into colour with the crags:<br />
And he, that once was king, had on a crown<br />
Of diamonds, one in front, and four aside.<br />
And Arthur came, and labouring up the pass,<br />
All in a misty moonshine, unawares<br />
Had trodden that crown&rsquo;d skeleton, and the skull<br />
Brake from the nape, and from the skull the crown<br />
Roll&rsquo;d into light, and turning on its rims<br />
Fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn:<br />
And down the shingly scaur he plunged, and caught,<br />
And set it on his head, and in his heart<br />
Heard murmurs, &lsquo;Lo, thou likewise shalt be
King.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The diamonds reappear in the scene of Guinevere&rsquo;s
jealousy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All in an oriel on the
summer side,<br />
Vine-clad, of Arthur&rsquo;s palace toward the stream,<br />
They met, and Lancelot kneeling utter&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Queen,<br
/>
Lady, my liege, in whom I have my joy,<br />
Take, what I had not won except for you,<br />
These jewels, and make me happy, making them<br />
An armlet for the roundest arm on earth,<br />
Or necklace for a neck to which the swan&rsquo;s<br />
Is tawnier than her cygnet&rsquo;s: these are words:<br />
Your beauty is your beauty, and I sin<br />
In speaking, yet O grant my worship of it<br />
Words, as we grant grief tears.&nbsp; Such sin in words,<br />
Perchance, we both can pardon: but, my Queen,<br />
I hear of rumours flying thro&rsquo; your court.<br />
Our bond, as not the bond of man and wife,<br />
Should have in it an absoluter trust<br />
To make up that defect: let rumours be:<br />
When did not rumours fly? these, as I trust<br />
That you trust me in your own nobleness,<br />
I may not well believe that you believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While thus he spoke, half turn&rsquo;d away,
the Queen<br />
Brake from the vast oriel-embowering vine<br />
Leaf after leaf, and tore, and cast them off,<br />
Till all the place whereon she stood was green;<br />
Then, when he ceased, in one cold passive hand<br />
Received at once and laid aside the gems<br />
There on a table near her, and replied:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;It may be, I am quicker of belief<br
/>
Than you believe me, Lancelot of the Lake.<br />
Our bond is not the bond of man and wife.<br />
This good is in it, whatsoe&rsquo;er of ill,<br />
It can be broken easier.&nbsp; I for you<br />
This many a year have done despite and wrong<br />
To one whom ever in my heart of hearts<br />
I did acknowledge nobler.&nbsp; What are these?<br />
Diamonds for me! they had been thrice their worth<br />
Being your gift, had you not lost your own.<br />
To loyal hearts the value of all gifts<br />
Must vary as the giver&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Not for me!<br />
For her! for your new fancy.&nbsp; Only this<br />
Grant me, I pray you: have your joys apart.<br />
I doubt not that however changed, you keep<br />
So much of what is graceful: and myself<br />
Would shun to break those bounds of courtesy<br />
In which as Arthur&rsquo;s Queen I move and rule:<br />
So cannot speak my mind.&nbsp; An end to this!<br />
A strange one! yet I take it with Amen.<br />
So pray you, add my diamonds to her pearls;<br />
Deck her with these; tell her, she shines me down:<br />
An armlet for an arm to which the Queen&rsquo;s<br />
Is haggard, or a necklace for a neck<br />
O as much fairer&mdash;as a faith once fair<br />
Was richer than these diamonds&mdash;hers not mine&mdash;<br />
Nay, by the mother of our Lord himself,<br />
Or hers or mine, mine now to work my will&mdash;<br />
She shall not have them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying which she
seized,<br />
And, thro&rsquo; the casement standing wide for heat,<br />
Flung them, and down they flash&rsquo;d, and smote the stream.<br
/>
Then from the smitten surface flash&rsquo;d, as it were,<br />
Diamonds to meet them, and they past away.<br />
Then while Sir Lancelot leant, in half disdain<br />
At love, life, all things, on the window ledge,<br />
Close underneath his eyes, and right across<br />
Where these had fallen, slowly past the barge<br />
Whereon the lily maid of Astolat<br />
Lay smiling, like a star in blackest night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This affair of the diamonds is the chief addition to the old
tale, in which we already see the curse of lawless love, fallen
upon the jealous Queen and the long-enduring Lancelot.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is not the first time,&rdquo; said Sir Lancelot,
&ldquo;that ye have been displeased with me causeless, but,
madame, ever I must suffer you, but what sorrow I endure I take
no force&rdquo; (that is, &ldquo;I disregard&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The romance, and the poet, in his own despite, cannot but make
Lancelot the man we love, not Arthur or another.&nbsp; Human
nature perversely sides with Guinevere against the Blameless
King:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She broke into a little
scornful laugh:<br />
&lsquo;Arthur, my lord, Arthur, the faultless King,<br />
That passionate perfection, my good lord&mdash;<br />
But who can gaze upon the Sun in heaven?<br />
He never spake word of reproach to me,<br />
He never had a glimpse of mine untruth,<br />
He cares not for me: only here to-day<br />
There gleam&rsquo;d a vague suspicion in his eyes:<br />
Some meddling rogue has tamper&rsquo;d with him&mdash;else<br />
Rapt in this fancy of his Table Round,<br />
And swearing men to vows impossible,<br />
To make them like himself: but, friend, to me<br />
He is all fault who hath no fault at all:<br />
For who loves me must have a touch of earth;<br />
The low sun makes the colour: I am yours,<br />
Not Arthur&rsquo;s, as ye know, save by the bond.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not the beautiful Queen who wins us, our hearts are with
&ldquo;the innocence of love&rdquo; in Elaine.&nbsp; But Lancelot
has the charm that captivated Lavaine; and Tennyson&rsquo;s
Arthur remains</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The moral child without the craft to
rule,<br />
Else had he not lost me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed the romance of Malory makes Arthur deserve &ldquo;the
pretty popular name such manhood earns&rdquo; by his conduct as
regards Guinevere when she is accused by her enemies in the later
chapters.&nbsp; Yet Malory does not finally condone the sin which
baffles Lancelot&rsquo;s quest of the Holy Grail.</p>
<p>Tennyson at first was in doubt as to writing on the Grail, for
certain respects of reverence.&nbsp; When he did approach the
theme it was in a method of extreme condensation.&nbsp; The
romances on the Grail outrun the length even of medi&aelig;val
poetry and prose.&nbsp; They are exceedingly confused, as was
natural, if that hypothesis which regards the story as a
Christianised form of obscure Celtic myth be correct.&nbsp; Sir
Percivale&rsquo;s sister, in the Idyll, has the first vision of
the Grail:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sweet brother, I have seen the Holy
Grail:<br />
For, waked at dead of night, I heard a sound<br />
As of a silver horn from o&rsquo;er the hills<br />
Blown, and I thought, &lsquo;It is not Arthur&rsquo;s use<br />
To hunt by moonlight&rsquo;; and the slender sound<br />
As from a distance beyond distance grew<br />
Coming upon me&mdash;O never harp nor horn,<br />
Nor aught we blow with breath, or touch with hand,<br />
Was like that music as it came; and then<br />
Stream&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; my cell a cold and silver beam,<br />
And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail,<br />
Rose-red with beatings in it, as if alive,<br />
Till all the white walls of my cell were dyed<br />
With rosy colours leaping on the wall;<br />
And then the music faded, and the Grail<br />
Past, and the beam decay&rsquo;d, and from the walls<br />
The rosy quiverings died into the night.<br />
So now the Holy Thing is here again<br />
Among us, brother, fast thou too and pray,<br />
And tell thy brother knights to fast and pray,<br />
That so perchance the vision may be seen<br />
By thee and those, and all the world be heal&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Galahad, son of Lancelot and the first Elaine (who became
Lancelot&rsquo;s mistress by art magic), then vows himself to the
Quest, and, after the vision in hall at Camelot, the knights,
except Arthur, follow his example, to Arthur&rsquo;s grief.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ye follow wandering fires!&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably, or
perhaps, the poet indicates dislike of hasty spiritual
enthusiasms, of &ldquo;seeking for a sign,&rdquo; and of the
mysticism which betokens want of faith.&nbsp; The Middle Ages,
more than many readers know, were ages of doubt.&nbsp; Men
desired the witness of the senses to the truth of what the Church
taught, they wished to see that naked child of the romance
&ldquo;smite himself into&rdquo; the wafer of the
Sacrament.&nbsp; The author of the <i>Imitatio Christi</i>
discourages such vain and too curious inquiries as helped to rend
the Church, and divided Christendom into hostile camps.&nbsp; The
Quest of the actual Grail was a knightly form of theological
research into the unsearchable; undertaken, often in a secular
spirit of adventure, by sinful men.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s heart
is rather with human things:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;O brother,&rsquo;
ask&rsquo;d Ambrosius,&mdash;&lsquo;for in sooth<br />
These ancient books&mdash;and they would win thee&mdash;teem,<br
/>
Only I find not there this Holy Grail,<br />
With miracles and marvels like to these,<br />
Not all unlike; which oftentime I read,<br />
Who read but on my breviary with ease,<br />
Till my head swims; and then go forth and pass<br />
Down to the little thorpe that lies so close,<br />
And almost plaster&rsquo;d like a martin&rsquo;s nest<br />
To these old walls&mdash;and mingle with our folk;<br />
And knowing every honest face of theirs<br />
As well as ever shepherd knew his sheep,<br />
And every homely secret in their hearts,<br />
Delight myself with gossip and old wives,<br />
And ills and aches, and teethings, lyings-in,<br />
And mirthful sayings, children of the place,<br />
That have no meaning half a league away:<br />
Or lulling random squabbles when they rise,<br />
Chafferings and chatterings at the market-cross,<br />
Rejoice, small man, in this small world of mine,<br />
Yea, even in their hens and in their eggs.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to be Tennyson&rsquo;s original reading of the
Quest of the Grail.&nbsp; His own mysticism, which did not
strive, or cry, or seek after marvels, though marvels might come
unsought, is expressed in Arthur&rsquo;s words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;And spake I
not too truly, O my knights?<br />
Was I too dark a prophet when I said<br />
To those who went upon the Holy Quest,<br />
That most of them would follow wandering fires,<br />
Lost in the quagmire?&mdash;lost to me and gone,<br />
And left me gazing at a barren board,<br />
And a lean Order&mdash;scarce return&rsquo;d a tithe&mdash;<br />
And out of those to whom the vision came<br />
My greatest hardly will believe he saw;<br />
Another hath beheld it afar off,<br />
And leaving human wrongs to right themselves,<br />
Cares but to pass into the silent life.<br />
And one hath had the vision face to face,<br />
And now his chair desires him here in vain,<br />
However they may crown him otherwhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;&ldquo;And some among you held, that
if the King<br />
Had seen the sight he would have sworn the vow:<br />
Not easily, seeing that the King must guard<br />
That which he rules, and is but as the hind<br />
To whom a space of land is given to plow<br />
Who may not wander from the allotted field<br />
Before his work be done; but, being done,<br />
Let visions of the night or of the day<br />
Come, as they will; and many a time they come,<br />
Until this earth he walks on seems not earth,<br />
This light that strikes his eyeball is not light,<br />
This air that smites his forehead is not air<br />
But vision&mdash;yea, his very hand and foot&mdash;<br />
In moments when he feels he cannot die,<br />
And knows himself no vision to himself,<br />
Nor the high God a vision, nor that One<br />
Who rose again: ye have seen what ye have seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;So spake the King: I knew not all he
meant.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The closing lines declare, as far as the poet could declare
them, these subjective experiences of his which, in a manner
rarely parallelled, coloured and formed his thought on the
highest things.&nbsp; He introduces them even into this poem on a
topic which, because of its sacred associations, he for long did
not venture to touch.</p>
<p>In <i>Pelleas and Ettarre</i>&mdash;which deals with the
sorrows of one of the young knights who fill up the gaps left at
the Round Table by the mischances of the Quest&mdash;it would be
difficult to trace a Celtic original.&nbsp; For Malory, not
Celtic legend, supplied Tennyson with the germinal idea of a poem
which, in the romance, has no bearing on the final
catastrophe.&nbsp; Pelleas, a King of the Isles, loves the
beautiful Ettarre, &ldquo;a great lady,&rdquo; and for her wins
at a tourney the prize of the golden circlet.&nbsp; But she hates
and despises him, and Sir Gawain is a spectator when, as in the
poem, the felon knights of Ettarre bind and insult their
conqueror, Pelleas.&nbsp; Gawain promises to win the love of
Ettarre for Pelleas, and, as in the poem, borrows his arms and
horse, and pretends to have slain him.&nbsp; But in place of
turning Ettarre&rsquo;s heart towards Pelleas, Gawain becomes her
lover, and Pelleas, detecting them asleep, lays his naked sword
on their necks.&nbsp; He then rides home to die; but Nimue
(Vivien), the Lady of the Lake, restores him to health and
sanity.&nbsp; His fever gone, he scorns Ettarre, who, by
Nimue&rsquo;s enchantment, now loves him as much as she had hated
him.&nbsp; Pelleas weds Nimue, and Ettarre dies of a broken
heart.&nbsp; Tennyson, of course, could not make Nimue (his
Vivien) do anything benevolent.&nbsp; He therefore closes his
poem by a repetition of the effect in the case of Balin.&nbsp;
Pelleas is driven desperate by the treachery of Gawain, the
reported infidelity of Guinevere, and the general corruption of
the ideal.&nbsp; A shadow falls on Lancelot and Guinevere, and
Modred sees that his hour is drawing nigh.&nbsp; In spite of
beautiful passages this is not one of the finest of the Idylls,
save for the study of the fierce, hateful, and beautiful
<i>grande dame</i>, Ettarre.&nbsp; The narrative does little to
advance the general plot.&nbsp; In the original of Malory it has
no connection with the Lancelot cycle, except as far as it
reveals the treachery of Gawain, the gay and fair-spoken
&ldquo;light of love,&rdquo; brother of the traitor Modred.&nbsp;
A simpler treatment of the theme may be read in Mr
Swinburne&rsquo;s beautiful poem, <i>The Tale of Balen</i>.</p>
<p>It is in <i>The Last Tournament</i> that Modred finds the
beginning of his opportunity.&nbsp; The brief life of the Ideal
has burned itself out, as the year, in its vernal beauty when
Arthur came, is burning out in autumn.&nbsp; The poem is
purposely autumnal, with the autumn, not of mellow fruitfulness,
but of the &ldquo;flying gold of the ruined woodlands&rdquo; and
the dank odours of decay.&nbsp; In that miserable season is held
the Tourney of the Dead Innocence, with the blood-red prize of
rubies.&nbsp; With a wise touch Tennyson has represented the
Court as fallen not into vice only and crime, but into positive
vulgarity and bad taste.&nbsp; The Tournament is a carnival of
the &ldquo;smart&rdquo; and the third-rate.&nbsp; Courtesy is
dead, even Tristram is brutal, and in Iseult hatred of her
husband is as powerful as love of her lover.&nbsp; The satire
strikes at England, where the world has never been corrupt with a
good grace.&nbsp; It is a passage of arms neither gentle nor
joyous that Lancelot presides over:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The sudden trumpet
sounded as in a dream<br />
To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll<br />
Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:<br />
And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf<br />
And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume<br />
Went down it.&nbsp; Sighing weariedly, as one<br />
Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,<br />
When all the goodlier guests are past away,<br />
Sat their great umpire, looking o&rsquo;er the lists.<br />
He saw the laws that ruled the tournament<br />
Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down<br />
Before his throne of arbitration cursed<br />
The dead babe and the follies of the King;<br />
And once the laces of a helmet crack&rsquo;d,<br />
And show&rsquo;d him, like a vermin in its hole,<br />
Modred, a narrow face: anon he heard<br />
The voice that billow&rsquo;d round the barriers roar<br />
An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,<br />
But newly-enter&rsquo;d, taller than the rest,<br />
And armour&rsquo;d all in forest green, whereon<br />
There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,<br />
And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,<br />
With ever-scattering berries, and on shield<br />
A spear, a harp, a bugle&mdash;Tristram&mdash;late<br />
From overseas in Brittany return&rsquo;d,<br />
And marriage with a princess of that realm,<br />
Isolt the White&mdash;Sir Tristram of the Woods&mdash;<br />
Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain<br />
His own against him, and now yearn&rsquo;d to shake<br />
The burthen off his heart in one full shock<br />
With Tristram ev&rsquo;n to death: his strong hands gript<br />
And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,<br />
Until he groan&rsquo;d for wrath&mdash;so many of those,<br />
That ware their ladies&rsquo; colours on the casque,<br />
Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,<br />
And there with gibes and flickering mockeries<br />
Stood, while he mutter&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Craven crests!&nbsp; O
shame!<br />
What faith have these in whom they sware to love?<br />
The glory of our Round Table is no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the
gems,<br />
Not speaking other word than &lsquo;Hast thou won?<br />
Art thou the purest, brother?&nbsp; See, the hand<br />
Wherewith thou takest this, is red!&rsquo; to whom<br />
Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot&rsquo;s languorous mood,<br />
Made answer, &lsquo;Ay, but wherefore toss me this<br />
Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?<br />
Let be thy fair Queen&rsquo;s fantasy.&nbsp; Strength of heart<br
/>
And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,<br />
Are winners in this pastime of our King.<br />
My hand&mdash;belike the lance hath dript upon it&mdash;<br />
No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,<br />
Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield,<br />
Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;<br />
Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tristram round the gallery made his
horse<br />
Caracole; then bow&rsquo;d his homage, bluntly saying,<br />
&lsquo;Fair damsels, each to him who worships each<br />
Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold<br />
This day my Queen of Beauty is not here.&rsquo;<br />
And most of these were mute, some anger&rsquo;d, one<br />
Murmuring, &lsquo;All courtesy is dead,&rsquo; and one,<br />
&lsquo;The glory of our Round Table is no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and
mantle clung,<br />
And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day<br />
Went glooming down in wet and weariness:<br />
But under her black brows a swarthy one<br />
Laugh&rsquo;d shrilly, crying, &lsquo;Praise the patient
saints,<br />
Our one white day of Innocence hath past,<br />
Tho&rsquo; somewhat draggled at the skirt.&nbsp; So be it.<br />
The snowdrop only, flowering thro&rsquo; the year,<br />
Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide.<br />
Come&mdash;let us gladden their sad eyes, our Queen&rsquo;s<br />
And Lancelot&rsquo;s, at this night&rsquo;s solemnity<br />
With all the kindlier colours of the field.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arthur&rsquo;s last victory over a robber knight is
ingloriously squalid:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He ended: Arthur knew the
voice; the face<br />
Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name<br />
Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.<br />
And Arthur deign&rsquo;d not use of word or sword,<br />
But let the drunkard, as he stretch&rsquo;d from horse<br />
To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,<br />
Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp<br />
Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,<br />
Heard in dead night along that table-shore,<br />
Drops flat, and after the great waters break<br />
Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,<br />
Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,<br />
From less and less to nothing; thus he fell<br />
Head-heavy; then the knights, who watch&rsquo;d him,
roar&rsquo;d<br />
And shouted and leapt down upon the fall&rsquo;n;<br />
There trampled out his face from being known,<br />
And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:<br />
Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang<br />
Thro&rsquo; open doors, and swording right and left<br />
Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurl&rsquo;d<br />
The tables over and the wines, and slew<br />
Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,<br />
And all the pavement stream&rsquo;d with massacre:<br />
Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower,<br />
Which half that autumn night, like the live North,<br />
Red-pulsing up thro&rsquo; Alioth and Alcor,<br />
Made all above it, and a hundred meres<br />
About it, as the water Moab saw<br />
Come round by the East, and out beyond them flush&rsquo;d<br />
The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Guinevere</i> is one of the greatest of the Idylls.&nbsp;
Malory makes Lancelot more sympathetic; his fight, unarmed, in
Guinevere&rsquo;s chamber, against the felon knights, is one of
his most spirited scenes.&nbsp; Tennyson omits this, and omits
all the unpardonable behaviour of Arthur as narrated in
Malory.&nbsp; Critics have usually condemned the last parting of
Guinevere and Arthur, because the King doth preach too much to an
unhappy woman who has no reply.&nbsp; The position of Arthur is
not easily redeemable: it is difficult to conceive that a noble
nature could be, or should be, blind so long.&nbsp; He does
rehabilitate his Queen in her own self-respect, perhaps, by
assuring her that he loves her still:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let no man dream but that I love thee
still.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had he said that one line and no more, we might have loved him
better.&nbsp; In the Idylls we have not Malory&rsquo;s last
meeting of Lancelot and Guinevere, one of the scenes in which the
wandering composite romance ends as nobly as the
<i>Iliad</i>.</p>
<p><i>The Passing of Arthur</i>, except for a new introductory
passage of great beauty and appropriateness, is the <i>Morte
d&rsquo;Arthur</i>, first published in 1842:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So all day long the noise of battle
roll&rsquo;d<br />
Among the mountains by the winter sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year has run its course, spring, summer, gloomy autumn,
and dies in the mist of Arthur&rsquo;s last wintry battle in the
west&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the new sun rose, bringing the new
year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The splendid and sombre procession has passed, leaving us to
muse as to how far the poet has fulfilled his own ideal.&nbsp;
There could be no new epic: he gave a chain of heroic
Idylls.&nbsp; An epic there could not be, for the <i>Iliad</i>
and <i>Odyssey</i> have each a unity of theme, a narrative
compressed into a few days in the former, in the latter into
forty days of time.&nbsp; The tragedy of Arthur&rsquo;s reign
could not so be condensed; and Tennyson chose the only feasible
plan.&nbsp; He has left a work, not absolutely perfect, indeed,
but such as he conceived, after many tentative essays, and such
as he desired to achieve.&nbsp; His fame may not rest chiefly on
the Idylls, but they form one of the fairest jewels in the crown
that shines with unnumbered gems, each with its own glory.</p>
<h2><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>VIII.<br />
<i>ENOCH ARDEN</i>.&nbsp; THE DRAMAS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> success of the first volume of
the Idylls recompensed the poet for the slings and arrows that
gave <i>Maud</i> a hostile welcome.&nbsp; His next publication
was the beautiful <i>Tithonus</i>, a fit pendant to the
<i>Ulysses</i>, and composed about the same date
(1833&ndash;35).&nbsp; &ldquo;A quarter of a century ago,&rdquo;
Tennyson dates it, writing in 1860 to the Duke of Argyll.&nbsp;
He had found it when &ldquo;ferreting among my old books,&rdquo;
he said, in search of something for Thackeray, who was
establishing the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>.&nbsp; What must the
wealth of the poet have been, who, possessing <i>Tithonus</i> in
his portfolio, did not take the trouble to insert it in the
volumes of 1842!&nbsp; Nobody knows how many poems of
Tennyson&rsquo;s never even saw pen and ink, being composed
unwritten, and forgotten.&nbsp; At this time we find him
recommending Mr Browning&rsquo;s <i>Men and Women</i> to the
Duke, who, like many Tennysonians, does not seem to have been a
ready convert to his great contemporary.&nbsp; The Duke and
Duchess urged the Laureate to attempt the topic of the Holy
Grail, but he was not in the mood.&nbsp; Indeed the vision of the
Grail in the early <i>Sir Galahad</i> is doubtless happier than
the allegorical handling of a theme so obscure, remote, and
difficult, in the Idylls.&nbsp; He wrote his <i>Boadicea</i>, a
piece magnificent in itself, but of difficult popular access,
owing to the metrical experiment.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1860 he revisited Cornwall with F. T.
Palgrave, Mr Val Prinsep, and Mr Holman Hunt.&nbsp; They walked
in the rain, saw Tintagel and the Scilly Isles, and were
f&ecirc;ted by an enthusiastic captain of a little river steamer,
who was more interested in &ldquo;Mr Tinman and Mr Pancake&rdquo;
than the Celtic boatman of Ardtornish.&nbsp; The winter was
passed at Farringford, and the <i>Northern Farmer</i> was written
there, a Lincolnshire reminiscence, in the February of
1861.&nbsp; In autumn the Pyrenees were visited by Tennyson in
company with Arthur Clough and Mr Dakyns of Clifton
College.&nbsp; At Cauteretz in August, and among memories of the
old tour with Arthur Hallam, was written <i>All along the
Valley</i>.&nbsp; The ways, however, in Auvergne were
&ldquo;foul,&rdquo; and the diet &ldquo;unhappy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
dedication of the Idylls was written on the death of the Prince
Consort in December, and in January 1862 the Ode for the opening
of an exhibition.&nbsp; The poet was busy with his
&ldquo;Fisherman,&rdquo; <i>Enoch Arden</i>.&nbsp; The volume was
published in 1864, and Lord Tennyson says it has been, next to
<i>In Memoriam</i>, the most popular of his father&rsquo;s
works.&nbsp; One would have expected the one volume containing
the poems up to 1842 to hold that place.&nbsp; The new book,
however, mainly dealt with English, contemporary, and domestic
themes&mdash;&ldquo;the poetry of the affections.&rdquo;&nbsp; An
old woman, a district visitor reported, regarded <i>Enoch
Arden</i> as &ldquo;more beautiful&rdquo; than the other tracts
which were read to her.&nbsp; It is indeed a tender and touching
tale, based on a folk-story which Tennyson found current in
Brittany as well as in England.&nbsp; Nor is the unseen and
unknown landscape of the tropic isle less happily created by the
poet&rsquo;s imagination than the familiar English cliffs and
hazel copses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The mountain wooded to
the peak, the lawns<br />
And winding glades high up like ways to Heaven,<br />
The slender coco&rsquo;s drooping crown of plumes,<br />
The lightning flash of insect and of bird,<br />
The lustre of the long convolvuluses<br />
That coil&rsquo;d around the stately stems, and ran<br />
Ev&rsquo;n to the limit of the land, the glows<br />
And glories of the broad belt of the world,<br />
All these he saw; but what he fain had seen<br />
He could not see, the kindly human face,<br />
Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard<br />
The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,<br />
The league-long roller thundering on the reef,<br />
The moving whisper of huge trees that branch&rsquo;d<br />
And blossom&rsquo;d in the zenith, or the sweep<br />
Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,<br />
As down the shore he ranged, or all day long<br />
Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,<br />
A shipwreck&rsquo;d sailor, waiting for a sail:<br />
No sail from day to day, but every day<br />
The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts<br />
Among the palms and ferns and precipices;<br />
The blaze upon the waters to the east;<br />
The blaze upon his island overhead;<br />
The blaze upon the waters to the west;<br />
Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven,<br />
The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again<br />
The scarlet shafts of sunrise&mdash;but no sail.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Aylmer&rsquo;s Field</i> somewhat recalls the burden of
<i>Maud</i>, the curse of purse-proud wealth, but is too gloomy
to be a fair specimen of Tennyson&rsquo;s art.&nbsp; In <i>Sea
Dreams</i> (first published in 1860) the awful vision of
crumbling faiths is somewhat out of harmony with its
environment:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But round the North, a
light,<br />
A belt, it seem&rsquo;d, of luminous vapour, lay,<br />
And ever in it a low musical note<br />
Swell&rsquo;d up and died; and, as it swell&rsquo;d, a ridge<br
/>
Of breaker issued from the belt, and still<br />
Grew with the growing note, and when the note<br />
Had reach&rsquo;d a thunderous fulness, on those cliffs<br />
Broke, mixt with awful light (the same as that<br />
Living within the belt) whereby she saw<br />
That all those lines of cliffs were cliffs no more,<br />
But huge cathedral fronts of every age,<br />
Grave, florid, stern, as far as eye could see,<br />
One after one: and then the great ridge drew,<br />
Lessening to the lessening music, back,<br />
And past into the belt and swell&rsquo;d again<br />
Slowly to music: ever when it broke<br />
The statues, king or saint or founder fell;<br />
Then from the gaps and chasms of ruin left<br />
Came men and women in dark clusters round,<br />
Some crying, &lsquo;Set them up! they shall not fall!&rsquo;<br
/>
And others, &lsquo;Let them lie, for they have
fall&rsquo;n.&rsquo;<br />
And still they strove and wrangled: and she grieved<br />
In her strange dream, she knew not why, to find<br />
Their wildest wailings never out of tune<br />
With that sweet note; and ever as their shrieks<br />
Ran highest up the gamut, that great wave<br />
Returning, while none mark&rsquo;d it, on the crowd<br />
Broke, mixt with awful light, and show&rsquo;d their eyes<br />
Glaring, and passionate looks, and swept away<br />
The men of flesh and blood, and men of stone,<br />
To the waste deeps together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Then I fixt<br />
My wistful eyes on two fair images,<br />
Both crown&rsquo;d with stars and high among the stars,&mdash;<br
/>
The Virgin Mother standing with her child<br />
High up on one of those dark minster-fronts&mdash;<br />
Till she began to totter, and the child<br />
Clung to the mother, and sent out a cry<br />
Which mixt with little Margaret&rsquo;s, and I woke,<br />
And my dream awed me:&mdash;well&mdash;but what are
dreams?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The passage is rather fitted for a despairing mood of Arthur,
in the Idylls, than for the wife of the city clerk ruined by a
pious rogue.</p>
<p>The <i>Lucretius</i>, later published, is beyond praise as a
masterly study of the great Roman sceptic, whose heart is at
eternal odds with his Epicurean creed.&nbsp; Nascent madness, or
fever of the brain drugged by the blundering love philtre, is not
more cunningly treated in the mad scenes of <i>Maud</i>.&nbsp; No
prose commentary on the <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, however long and
learned, conveys so clearly as this concise study in verse the
sense of magnificent mingled ruin in the mind and poem of the
Roman.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Experiments in Quantity&rdquo; were, perhaps,
suggested by Mr Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s Lectures on the
Translating of Homer.&nbsp; Mr Arnold believed in a translation
into English hexameters.&nbsp; His negative criticism of other
translators and translations was amusing and instructive: he had
an easy game to play with the Yankee-doodle metre of F. W.
Newman, the ponderous blank verse of Cowper, the tripping and
clipping couplets of Pope, the Elizabethan fantasies of
Chapman.&nbsp; But Mr Arnold&rsquo;s hexameters were neither
musical nor rapid: they only exhibited a new form of
failure.&nbsp; As the Prince of Abyssinia said to his tutor,
&ldquo;Enough; you have convinced me that no man can be a
poet,&rdquo; so Mr Arnold went some way to prove that no man can
translate Homer.</p>
<p>Tennyson had the lowest opinion of hexameters as an English
metre for serious purposes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These lame hexameters the
strong-wing&rsquo;d music of Homer!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Tennyson says, &ldquo;German hexameters he disliked even
more than English.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed there is not much room for
preference.&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s Alcaics (<i>Milton</i>) were
intended to follow the Greek rather than the Horatian model, and
resulted, at all events, in a poem worthy of the
&ldquo;mighty-mouth&rsquo;d inventor of harmonies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The specimen of the <i>Iliad</i> in blank verse, beautiful as it
is, does not, somehow, reproduce the music of Homer.&nbsp; It is
entirely Tennysonian, as in</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Roll&rsquo;d the rich vapour far into the
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader, in that one line, recognises the voice and trick
of the English poet, and is far away from the Chian:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As when in heaven the stars about the
moon<br />
Look beautiful, when all the winds are laid,<br />
And every height comes out, and jutting peak<br />
And valley, and the immeasurable heavens<br />
Break open to their highest, and all the stars<br />
Shine, and the Shepherd gladdens in his heart:<br />
So many a fire between the ships and stream<br />
Of Xanthus blazed before the towers of Troy,<br />
A thousand on the plain; and close by each<br />
Sat fifty in the blaze of burning fire;<br />
And eating hoary grain and pulse the steeds,<br />
Fixt by their cars, waited the golden dawn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is excellent, is poetry, escapes the conceits of Pope
(who never &ldquo;wrote with his eye on the object&rdquo;), but
is pure Tennyson.&nbsp; We have not yet, probably we never shall
have, an adequate rendering of the <i>Iliad</i> into verse, and
prose translations do not pretend to be adequate.&nbsp; When
parents and dominies have abolished the study of Greek,
something, it seems, will have been lost to the
world,&mdash;something which even Tennyson could not restore in
English.&nbsp; He thought blank verse the proper equivalent; but
it is no equivalent.&nbsp; One even prefers his own
prose:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Nor did Paris linger in his lofty halls, but when
he had girt on his gorgeous armour, all of varied bronze, then he
rushed thro&rsquo; the city, glorying in his airy feet.&nbsp; And
as when a stall-kept horse, that is barley-fed at the manger,
breaketh his tether, and dasheth thro&rsquo; the plain, spurning
it, being wont to bathe himself in the fair-running river,
rioting, and reareth his head, and his mane flieth back on either
shoulder, and he glorieth in his beauty, and his knees bear him
at the gallop to the haunts and meadows of the mares; so ran the
son of Priam, Paris, from the height of Pergamus, all in arms,
glittering like the sun, laughing for light-heartedness, and his
swift feet bare him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February 1865 Tennyson lost the mother whose portrait he
drew in <i>Isabel</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;a thing enskied and
sainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1865 the Tennysons went on a Continental
tour, and visited Waterloo, Weimar, and Dresden; in September
they entertained Emma I., Queen of the Sandwich Islands.&nbsp;
The months passed quietly at home or in town.&nbsp; The poet had
written his <i>Lucretius</i>, and, to please Sir George Grove,
wrote <i>The Song of the Wrens</i>, for music.&nbsp; Tennyson had
not that positive aversion to music which marked Dr Johnson,
Victor Hugo, Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, and some other
poets.&nbsp; Nay, he liked Beethoven, which places him higher in
the musical scale than Scott, who did not rise above a Border
lilt or a Jacobite ditty.&nbsp; The Wren songs, entitled <i>The
Window</i>, were privately printed by Sir Ivor Guest in 1867,
were set to music by Sir Arthur Sullivan, and published by
Strahan in December 1870.&nbsp; &ldquo;A puppet,&rdquo; Tennyson
called the song-book, &ldquo;whose only merit is, perhaps, that
it can dance to Mr Sullivan&rsquo;s instrument.&nbsp; I am sorry
that my puppet should have to dance at all in the dark shadow of
these days&rdquo; (the siege of Paris), &ldquo;but the music is
now completed, and I am bound by my promise.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
verses are described as &ldquo;partly in the old style,&rdquo;
but the true old style of the Elizabethan and cavalier days is
lost.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1867 the Tennysons moved to a farmhouse near
Haslemere, at that time not a centre of literary Londoners.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sandy soil and heather-scented air&rdquo; allured them,
and the result was the purchase of land, and the building of
Aldworth, Mr Knowles being the architect.&nbsp; In autumn
Tennyson visited Lyme Regis, and, like all other travellers
thither, made a pilgrimage to the Cobb, sacred to Louisa
Musgrove.&nbsp; The poet now began the study of Hebrew, having a
mind to translate the Book of Job, a vision unfulfilled.&nbsp; In
1868 he thought of publishing his boyish piece, <i>The
Lover&rsquo;s Tale</i>, but delayed.&nbsp; An anonymously edited
piracy of this and other poems was perpetrated in 1875, limited,
at least nominally, to fifty copies.</p>
<p>In July Longfellow visited Tennyson.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Longfellows and he talked much of spiritualism, for he was
greatly interested in that subject, but he suspended his
judgment, and thought that, if in such manifestations there is
anything, &lsquo;Pucks, not the spirits of dead men, reveal
themselves.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; This was Southey&rsquo;s
suggestion, as regards the celebrated disturbances in the house
of the Wesleys.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wit might have much to say, wisdom,
little,&rdquo; said Sam Wesley.&nbsp; Probably the talk about
David Dunglas Home, the &ldquo;medium&rdquo; then in vogue, led
to the discussion of &ldquo;spiritualism.&rdquo;&nbsp; We do not
hear that Tennyson ever had the curiosity to see Home, whom Mr
Browning so firmly detested.</p>
<p>In September <i>The Holy Grail</i> was begun: it was finished
&ldquo;in about a week.&nbsp; It came like a breath of
inspiration.&rdquo;&nbsp; The subject had for many years been
turned about in the poet&rsquo;s mind, which, of course, was busy
in these years of apparent inactivity.&nbsp; At this time (August
1868) Tennyson left his old publishers, the Moxons, for Mr
Strahan, who endured till 1872.&nbsp; Then he was succeeded by
Messrs H. S. King &amp; Co., who gave place (1879) to Messrs
Kegan Paul &amp; Co., while in 1884 Messrs Macmillan became, and
continue to be, the publishers.&nbsp; A few pieces, except
<i>Lucretius</i> (<i>Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, May 1868)
unimportant, appeared in serials.</p>
<p>Very early in 1869 <i>The Coming of Arthur</i> was composed,
while Tennyson was reading Browning&rsquo;s <i>The Ring and the
Book</i>.&nbsp; He and his great contemporary were on terms of
affectionate friendship, though Tennyson, perhaps, appreciated
less of Browning than Browning of Tennyson.&nbsp; Meanwhile
&ldquo;Old Fitz&rdquo; kept up a fire of unsympathetic growls at
Browning and all his works.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been trying in
vain to read it&rdquo; (<i>The Ring and the Book</i>), &ldquo;and
yet the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> tells me it is wonderfully
fine.&rdquo;&nbsp; FitzGerald&rsquo;s ply had been taken long
ago; he wanted verbal music in poetry (no exorbitant desire),
while, in Browning, <i>carmina desunt</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, a
personal feeling, as if Browning was Tennyson&rsquo;s rival,
affected the judgment of the author of <i>Omar
Kh&aacute;yy&aacute;m</i>.&nbsp; We may almost call him
&ldquo;the author.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Holy Grail</i>, with the smaller poems, such as
<i>Lucretius</i>, was published at the end of 1869.&nbsp;
FitzGerald appears to have preferred <i>The Northern Farmer</i>,
&ldquo;the substantial rough-spun nature I knew,&rdquo; to all
the visionary knights in the airy Quest.&nbsp; To compare
&ldquo;&mdash;&rdquo; (obviously Browning) with Tennyson, was
&ldquo;to compare an old Jew&rsquo;s curiosity shop with the
Phidian Marbles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s poems &ldquo;being
clear to the bottom as well as beautiful, do not seem to cockney
eyes so deep as muddy waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In November 1870 <i>The Last Tournament</i> was begun; it was
finished in May 1871.&nbsp; Conceivably the vulgar scandals of
the last days of the French Imperial <i>r&eacute;gime</i> may
have influenced Tennyson&rsquo;s picture of the corruption of
Arthur&rsquo;s Court; but the Empire did not begin, like the
Round Table, with aspirations after the Ideal.&nbsp; In the
autumn of the year Tennyson entertained, and was entertained by,
Mr Huxley.&nbsp; In their ideas about ultimate things two men
could not vary more widely, but each delighted in the
other&rsquo;s society.&nbsp; In the spring of 1872 Tennyson
visited Paris and the ruins of the Louvre.&nbsp; He read Victor
Hugo, and Alfred de Musset, whose comedies he admired.&nbsp; The
little that we hear of his opinion of the other great poet runs
to this effect, &ldquo;Victor Hugo is an unequal genius,
sometimes sublime; he reminds one that there is but one step
between the sublime and the ridiculous,&rdquo; but the example by
which Tennyson illustrated this was derived from one of the
poet&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; In these we meet not only the sublime
and the ridiculous, but passages which leave us in some
perplexity as to their true category.&nbsp; One would have
expected Hugo&rsquo;s lyrics to be Tennyson&rsquo;s favourites,
but only <i>Gastibelza</i> is mentioned in that character.&nbsp;
At this time Tennyson was vexed by</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Art with poisonous honey stolen from
France,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a phrase which cannot apply to Hugo.&nbsp; Meanwhile
<i>Gareth</i> was being written, and the knight&rsquo;s song for
<i>The Coming of Arthur</i>.&nbsp; <i>Gareth and Lynette</i>,
with minor pieces, appeared in 1872.&nbsp; <i>Balin and Balan</i>
was composed later, to lead up to <i>Vivien</i>, to which,
perhaps, <i>Balin and Balan</i> was introduction sufficient had
it been the earlier written.&nbsp; But the Idylls have already
been discussed as arranged in sequence.&nbsp; The completion of
the Idylls, with the patriotic epilogue, was followed by the
offer of a baronetcy.&nbsp; Tennyson preferred that he and his
wife &ldquo;should remain plain Mr and Mrs,&rdquo; though
&ldquo;I hope that I have too much of the old-world loyalty not
to wear my lady&rsquo;s favours against all comers, should you
think that it would be more agreeable to her Majesty that I
should do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Idylls ended, Tennyson in 1874 began to contemplate a
drama, choosing the topic, perhaps neither popular nor in an
Aristotelian sense tragic, of Mary Tudor.&nbsp; This play was
published, and put on the stage by Sir Henry Irving in
1875.&nbsp; <i>Harold</i> followed in 1876, <i>The Cup</i> in
1881 (at the Lyceum), <i>The Promise of May</i> (at the Globe) in
1882, <i>Becket</i> in 1884, with <i>The Foresters</i> in
1892.&nbsp; It seems best to consider all the dramatic period of
Tennyson&rsquo;s work, a period reached so strangely late in his
career, in the sequence of the Plays.&nbsp; The task is one from
which I shrink, as conscious of entire ignorance of the stage and
of lack of enthusiasm for the drama.&nbsp; Great dramatic authors
have, almost invariably, had long practical knowledge of the
scenes and of what is behind them.&nbsp; Shakespeare and his
contemporaries, Moli&egrave;re and his contemporaries, had lived
their lives on the boards and in the <i>foyer</i>, actors
themselves, or in daily touch with actors and actresses.&nbsp; In
the present day successful playwrights appear to live much in the
world of the players.&nbsp; They have practical knowledge of the
conventions and conditions which the stage imposes.&nbsp; Neither
Browning nor Mr Swinburne (to take great names) has had, it
seems, much of this practical and daily experience; their dramas
have been acted but rarely, if at all, and many examples prove
that neither poetical genius nor the genius for prose fiction can
enable men to produce plays which hold their own on the
boards.&nbsp; This may be the fault of public taste, or partly of
public taste, partly of defect in practical knowledge on the side
of the authors.&nbsp; Of the stage, by way of practice, Tennyson
had known next to nothing, yet his dramas were written to be
acted, and acted some of them were.&nbsp; &ldquo;For himself, he
was aware,&rdquo; says his biographer, &ldquo;that he wanted
intimate knowledge of the mechanical details necessary for the
modern stage, although in early and middle life he had been a
constant playgoer, and would keenly follow the action of a play,
criticising the characterisation, incidents, scenic effects,
situations, language, and dramatic points.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
quite prepared to be &ldquo;edited&rdquo; for acting purposes by
the players.&nbsp; Miss Mary Anderson says that &ldquo;he was
ready to sacrifice even his <i>most</i> beautiful lines for the
sake of a real dramatic effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proved unusual common-sense in a poet.&nbsp; Modern times
and manners are notoriously unfavourable to the serious
drama.&nbsp; In the age of the Greek tragedians, as in the days
of &ldquo;Eliza and our James,&rdquo; reading was not very
common, and life was much more passed in public than among
ourselves, when people go to the play for light recreation, or to
be shocked.&nbsp; So various was the genius of Tennyson, that had
he devoted himself early to the stage, and had he been backed by
a manager with the enterprise and intelligence of Sir Henry
Irving, it is impossible to say how much he might have done to
restore the serious drama.&nbsp; But we cannot regret that he was
occupied in his prime with other things, nor can we expect to
find his noblest and most enduring work in the dramatic
experiments of his latest years.&nbsp; It is notable that, in his
opinion, &ldquo;the conditions of the dramatic art are much more
complex than they were.&rdquo;&nbsp; For example, we have
&ldquo;the star system,&rdquo; which tends to allot what is, or
was, technically styled &ldquo;the fat,&rdquo; to one or two
popular players.&nbsp; Now, a poet like Tennyson will inevitably
distribute large quantities of what is most excellent to many
characters, and the consequent difficulties may be appreciated by
students of our fallen nature.&nbsp; The poet added that to be a
first-rate historical playwright means much more work than
formerly, seeing that &ldquo;exact history&rdquo; has taken the
part of the &ldquo;chance chronicle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a misfortune.&nbsp; The dramas of the Attic stage,
with one or two exceptions, are based on myth and legend, not on
history, and even in the <i>Pers&aelig;</i>, grounded on
contemporary events, &AElig;schylus introduced the ghost of
Darius, not vouched for by &ldquo;exact history.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let
us conceive Shakespeare writing <i>Macbeth</i> in an age of
&ldquo;exact history.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hardly any of the play would
be left.&nbsp; Fleance and Banquo must go.&nbsp; Duncan becomes a
young man, and far from &ldquo;gracious.&rdquo;&nbsp; Macbeth
appears as the defender of the legitimist prince, Lulach, against
Duncan, a usurper.&nbsp; Lady Macbeth is a pattern to her sex,
and her lord is a clement and sagacious ruler.&nbsp; The witches
are ruled out of the piece.&nbsp; Difficulties arise about the
English aid to Malcolm.&nbsp; History, in fact, declines to be
dramatic.&nbsp; Liberties must be taken.&nbsp; In his plays of
the Mary Stuart cycle, Mr Swinburne telescopes the affair of
Darnley into that of Chastelard, which was much earlier.&nbsp; He
makes Mary Beaton (in love with Chastelard) a kind of avenging
fate, who will never leave the Queen till her head falls at
Fotheringay; though, in fact, after a flirtation with Randolph,
Mary Beaton married Ogilvy of Boyne (really in love with Lady
Bothwell), and not one of the four Maries was at
Fotheringay.&nbsp; An artist ought to be allowed to follow
legend, of its essence dramatic, or to manipulate history as he
pleases.&nbsp; Our modern scrupulosity is pedantic.&nbsp; But
Tennyson read a long list of books for his <i>Queen Mary</i>,
though it does not appear that he made original researches in
MSS.&nbsp; These labours occupied 1874 and 1875.&nbsp; Yet it
would be foolish to criticise his <i>Queen Mary</i> as if we were
criticising &ldquo;exact history.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
play&rsquo;s the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poet thought that &ldquo;Bloody Mary&rdquo; &ldquo;had
been harshly judged by the verdict of popular
tradition.&rdquo;&nbsp; So have most characters to whom popular
dislike affixes the popular epithet&mdash;&ldquo;Bloody
Claverse,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bloody Mackenzie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bloody
Balfour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mary had the courage of the Tudors.&nbsp;
She &ldquo;edified all around her by her cheerfulness, her piety,
and her resignation to the will of Providence,&rdquo; in her last
days (Lingard).&nbsp; Camden calls her &ldquo;a queen never
praised enough for the purity of her morals, her charity to the
poor&rdquo; (she practised as a district visitor), &ldquo;and her
liberality to the nobles and the clergy.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was
&ldquo;pious, merciful, pure, and ever to be praised, if we
overlook her erroneous opinions in religion,&rdquo; says
Godwin.&nbsp; She had been grievously wronged from her youth
upwards.&nbsp; In Elizabeth she had a sister and a rival, a
constant intriguer against her, and a kinswoman far from
amiable.&nbsp; Despite &ldquo;the kindness and attention of
Philip&rdquo; (Lingard), affairs of State demanded his absence
from England.&nbsp; The disappointment as to her expected child
was cruel.&nbsp; She knew that she had become unpopular, and she
could not look for the success of her Church, to which she was
sincerely attached.&nbsp; M. Auguste Filon thought that <i>Queen
Mary</i> might secure dramatic rank for Tennyson, &ldquo;if a
great actress arose who conceived a passion for the part of
Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that was not to be expected.&nbsp; Mary
was middle-aged, plain, and in aspect now terrible, now
rueful.&nbsp; No great actress will throw herself with passion
into such an ungrateful part.&nbsp; &ldquo;Throughout all
history,&rdquo; Tennyson said, &ldquo;there was nothing more
mournful than the final tragedy of this woman.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>Mournful</i> it is, but not tragic.&nbsp; There is nothing
grand at the close, as when Mary Stuart conquers death and evil
fame, redeeming herself by her courage and her calm, and
extending over unborn generations that witchery which her enemies
dreaded more than an army with banners.</p>
<p>Moreover, popular tradition can never forgive the fires of
Smithfield.&nbsp; It was Mary Tudor&rsquo;s misfortune that she
had the power to execute, on a great scale, that faculty of
persecution to the death for which her Presbyterian and other
Protestant opponents pined in vain.&nbsp; Mr Froude says of her,
&ldquo;For the first and last time the true Ultramontane spirit
was dominant in England, the genuine conviction that, as the
orthodox prophets and sovereigns of Israel slew the worshippers
of Baal, so were Catholic rulers called upon, as their first
duty, to extirpate heretics as the enemies of God and
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was precisely the spirit of Knox and other
Presbyterian denouncers of death against &ldquo;Idolaters&rdquo;
(Catholics).&nbsp; But the Scottish preachers were always
thwarted: Mary and her advisers had their way, as, earlier,
Latimer had preached against sufferers at the stake.&nbsp; To the
stake, which he feared so greatly, Cranmer had sent persons not
of his own fleeting shade of theological opinion.&nbsp; These men
had burned Anabaptists, but all that is lightly forgotten by
Protestant opinion.&nbsp; Under Mary (whoever may have been
primarily responsible) Cranmer and Latimer were treated as they
had treated others.&nbsp; Moreover, some two hundred poor men and
women had dared the fiery death.&nbsp; The persecution was on a
scale never forgiven or forgotten, since Mary began <i>cerdonibus
esse timenda</i>.&nbsp; Mary was not essentially inclement.&nbsp;
Despite Renard, the agent of the Emperor, she spared that lord of
fluff and feather, Courtenay, and she spared Elizabeth.&nbsp;
Lady Jane she could not save, the girl who was a queen by grace
of God and of her own royal nature.&nbsp; But Mary will never be
pardoned by England.&nbsp; &ldquo;Few men or women have lived
less capable of doing knowingly a wrong thing,&rdquo; says Mr
Froude, a great admirer of Tennyson&rsquo;s play.&nbsp; Yet,
taking Mr Froude&rsquo;s own view, Mary&rsquo;s abject and
superannuated passion for Philip; her ecstasies during her
supposed pregnancy; &ldquo;the forlorn hours when she would sit
on the ground with her knees drawn to her face,&rdquo; with all
her &ldquo;symptoms of hysterical derangement, leave little room,
as we think of her, for other feelings than pity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Unfortunately, feelings of pity for a person so distraught, so
sourly treated by fortune, do not suffice for tragedy.&nbsp; When
we contemplate Antigone or &OElig;dipus, it is not with a
sentiment of pity struggling against abhorrence.</p>
<p>For these reasons the play does not seem to have a good
dramatic subject.&nbsp; The unity is given by Mary herself and
her fortunes, and these are scarcely dramatic.&nbsp; History
prevents the introduction of Philip till the second scene of the
third act.&nbsp; His entrance is <i>manqu&eacute;</i>; he merely
accompanies Cardinal Pole, who takes command of the scene, and
Philip does not get in a word till after a long conversation
between the Queen and the Cardinal.&nbsp; Previously Philip had
only crossed the stage in a procession, yet when he does appear
he is bereft of prominence.&nbsp; The interest as regards him is
indicated, in Act I. scene v., by Mary&rsquo;s kissing his
miniature.&nbsp; Her blighted love for him is one main motive of
the tragedy, but his own part appears too subordinate in the play
as published.&nbsp; The interest is scattered among the vast
crowd of characters; and Mr R. H. Hutton remarked at the time
that he &ldquo;remains something of a cold, cruel, and sensual
shadow.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are more interested in Wyatt, Cranmer,
Gardiner, and others; or at least their parts are more
interesting.&nbsp; Yet in no case does the interest of any
character, except of Mary and Elizabeth, remain continuous
throughout the play.&nbsp; Tennyson himself thought that
&ldquo;the real difficulty of the drama is to give sufficient
relief to its intense sadness. . . . Nothing less than the holy
calm of the meek and penitent Cranmer can be adequate artistic
relief.&rdquo;&nbsp; But not much relief can be drawn from a man
about to be burned alive, and history does not tempt us to keen
sympathy with the recanting archbishop, at least if we agree with
Macaulay rather than with Froude.</p>
<p>I venture to think that historical tradition, as usual,
offered a better motive than exact history.&nbsp; Following
tradition, we see in Mary a cloud of hateful gloom, from which
England escapes into the glorious dawn of &ldquo;the Gospel
light,&rdquo; and of Elizabeth, who might be made a triumphantly
sympathetic character.&nbsp; That is the natural and popular
course which the drama might take.&nbsp; But Tennyson&rsquo;s
history is almost critical and scientific.&nbsp; Points of
difficult and debated evidence (as to Elizabeth&rsquo;s part in
Wyatt&rsquo;s rebellion) are discussed.&nbsp; There is no contest
of day and darkness, of Truth and Error.&nbsp; The characters are
in that perplexed condition about creeds which was their actual
state after the political and social and religious chaos produced
by Henry VIII.&nbsp; Gardiner is a Catholic, but not an
Ultramontane; Lord William Howard is a Catholic, but not a
fanatic; we find a truculent Anabaptist, or Socialist, and a
citizen whose pride is his moderation.&nbsp; The native
uncritical tendency of the drama is to throw up hats and halloo
for Elizabeth and an open Bible.&nbsp; In place of this, Cecil
delivers a well-considered analysis of the character of
Elizabeth:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Eliz.</i>&nbsp; God
guide me lest I lose the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exit Elizabeth</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cecil</i>.&nbsp; Many points
weather&rsquo;d, many perilous ones,<br />
At last a harbour opens; but therein<br />
Sunk rocks&mdash;they need fine steering&mdash;much it is<br />
To be nor mad, nor bigot&mdash;have a mind&mdash;<br />
Nor let Priests&rsquo; talk, or dream of worlds to be,<br />
Miscolour things about her&mdash;sudden touches<br />
For him, or him&mdash;sunk rocks; no passionate faith&mdash;<br
/>
But&mdash;if let be&mdash;balance and compromise;<br />
Brave, wary, sane to the heart of her&mdash;a Tudor<br />
School&rsquo;d by the shadow of death&mdash;a Boleyn, too,<br />
Glancing across the Tudor&mdash;not so well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is excellent as historical criticism, in the favourable
sense; but the drama, by its nature, demands something not
critical but triumphant and one-sided.&nbsp; The character of
Elizabeth is one of the best in the play, as her soliloquy (Act
III. scene v.) is one of the finest of the speeches.&nbsp; We see
her courage, her coquetry, her dissimulation, her
arrogance.&nbsp; But while this is the true Elizabeth, it is not
the idealised Elizabeth whom English loyalty created, lived for,
and died for.&nbsp; Mr Froude wrote, &ldquo;You have given us the
greatest of all your works,&rdquo; an opinion which the world can
never accept.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have reclaimed one more section of
English History from the wilderness, and given it a form in which
it will be fixed for ever.&nbsp; No one since Shakespeare has
done that.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr Froude had done it, and
Tennyson&rsquo;s reading of &ldquo;the section&rdquo; is mainly
that of Mr Froude.&nbsp; Mr Gladstone found that Cranmer and
Gardiner &ldquo;are still in a considerable degree mysteries to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; A mystery Cranmer must remain.&nbsp; Perhaps the
&ldquo;crowds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Voices&rdquo; are not the least
excellent of the characters, Tennyson&rsquo;s humour finding an
opportunity in them, and in Joan and Tib.&nbsp; His idyllic charm
speaks in the words of Lady Clarence to the fevered Queen; and
there is dramatic genius in her reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Mary</i>.&nbsp; What
is the strange thing happiness?&nbsp; Sit down here:<br />
Tell me thine happiest hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lady Clarence</i>.&nbsp; I will, if
that<br />
May make your Grace forget yourself a little.<br />
There runs a shallow brook across our field<br />
For twenty miles, where the black crow flies five,<br />
And doth so bound and babble all the way<br />
As if itself were happy.&nbsp; It was May-time,<br />
And I was walking with the man I loved.<br />
I loved him, but I thought I was not loved.<br />
And both were silent, letting the wild brook<br />
Speak for us&mdash;till he stoop&rsquo;d and gather&rsquo;d
one<br />
From out a bed of thick forget-me-nots,<br />
Look&rsquo;d hard and sweet at me, and gave it me.<br />
I took it, tho&rsquo; I did not know I took it,<br />
And put it in my bosom, and all at once<br />
I felt his arms about me, and his lips&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mary</i>.&nbsp; O God!&nbsp; I have been
too slack, too slack;<br />
There are Hot Gospellers even among our guards&mdash;<br />
Nobles we dared not touch.&nbsp; We have but burnt<br />
The heretic priest, workmen, and women and children.<br />
Wet, famine, ague, fever, storm, wreck, wrath,&mdash;<br />
We have so play&rsquo;d the coward; but by God&rsquo;s grace,<br
/>
We&rsquo;ll follow Philip&rsquo;s leading, and set up<br />
The Holy Office here&mdash;garner the wheat,<br />
And burn the tares with unquenchable fire!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conclusion, in the acting edition, printed in the
Biography, appears to be an improvement on that in the text as
originally published.&nbsp; Unhappy as the drama essentially is,
the welcome which Mr Browning gave both to the published work and
to the acted play&mdash;&ldquo;a complete success&rdquo;:
&ldquo;conception, execution, the whole and the parts, I see
nowhere the shadow of a fault&rdquo;&mdash;offers
&ldquo;relief&rdquo; in actual human nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
the greatest-brained poet in England,&rdquo; Tennyson said, on a
later occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Violets fade, he has given me a
crown of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before writing <i>Harold</i> (1876) the poet &ldquo;studied
many recent plays,&rdquo; and re-read &AElig;schylus and
Sophocles.&nbsp; For history he went to the Bayeux tapestry, the
<i>Roman de Rou</i>, Lord Lytton, and Freeman.&nbsp; Students of
a recent controversy will observe that, following Freeman, he
retains the famous palisade, so grievously battered by the
axe-strokes of Mr Horace Round.&nbsp; <i>Harold</i> is a piece
more compressed, and much more in accordance with the traditions
of the drama, than <i>Queen Mary</i>.&nbsp; The topic is tragic
indeed: the sorrow being that of a great man, a great king, the
bulwark of a people that fell with his fall.&nbsp; Moreover, as
the topic is treated, the play is rich in the irony usually
associated with the name of Sophocles.&nbsp; Victory comes before
a fall.&nbsp; Harold, like Antigone, is torn between two
duties&mdash;his oath and the claims of his country.&nbsp; His
ruin comes from what Aristotle would call his
<i>&#7937;&mu;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&#8055;&alpha;</i>, his fault in
swearing the oath to William.&nbsp; The hero himself; recking
little, after a superstitious moment, of the concealed relics
over which he swore, deems his offence to lie in swearing a vow
which he never meant to keep.&nbsp; The persuasions which urge
him to this course are admirably presented: England, Edith, his
brother&rsquo;s freedom, were at stake.&nbsp; Casuistry, or even
law, would have absolved him easily; an oath taken under duresse
is of no avail.&nbsp; But Harold&rsquo;s &ldquo;honour rooted in
dishonour stood,&rdquo; and he cannot so readily absolve
himself.&nbsp; Bruce and the bishops who stood by Bruce had no
such scruples: they perjured themselves often, on the most sacred
relics, especially the bishops.&nbsp; But Harold rises above the
medi&aelig;val and magical conception of the oath, and goes to
his doom conscious of a stain on his honour, of which only a
deeper stain, that of falseness to his country, could make him
clean.&nbsp; This is a truly tragic stroke of destiny.&nbsp; The
hero&rsquo;s character is admirably noble, patient, and
simple.&nbsp; The Confessor also is as true in art as to history,
and his vision of the fall and rise of England is a noble
passage.&nbsp; In Aldwyth we have something of Vivien, with a
grain of conscience, and the part of Edith Swan&rsquo;s-neck has
a restrained and classic pathos in contrast with the melancholy
of Wulfnoth.&nbsp; The piece, as the poet said, is a
&ldquo;tragedy of doom,&rdquo; of deepening and darkening omens,
as in the <i>Odyssey</i> and <i>Njal&rsquo;s Saga</i>.&nbsp; The
battle scene, with the choruses of the monks, makes a noble
close.</p>
<p>FitzGerald remained loyal, but it was to &ldquo;a fairy Prince
who came from other skies than these rainy ones,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the wretched critics,&rdquo; as G. H. Lewes called them,
seem to have been unfriendly.&nbsp; In fact (besides the innate
wretchedness of all critics), they grudged the time and labour
given to the drama, in an undramatic age.&nbsp; <i>Harold</i> had
not what FitzGerald called &ldquo;the old champagne
flavour&rdquo; of the vintage of 1842.</p>
<p><i>Becket</i> was begun in 1876, printed in 1879, and
published in 1884.&nbsp; Before that date, in 1880, Tennyson
produced one of the volumes of poetry which was more welcome than
a play to most of his admirers.&nbsp; The intervening years
passed in the Isle of Wight, at Aldworth, in town, and in summer
tours, were of no marked biographical interest.&nbsp; The poet
was close on three score and ten&mdash;he reached that limit in
1879.&nbsp; The days darkened around him, as darken they must: in
the spring of 1879 he lost his favourite brother, himself a poet
of original genius, Charles Tennyson Turner.&nbsp; In May of the
same year he published <i>The Lover&rsquo;s Tale</i>, which has
been treated here among his earliest works.&nbsp; His hours, and
(to some extent) his meals, were regulated by Sir Andrew
Clark.&nbsp; He planted trees, walked, read, loitered in his
garden, and kept up his old friendships, while he made that of
the great Gordon.&nbsp; Compliments passed between him and Victor
Hugo, who had entertained Lionel Tennyson in Paris, and wrote:
&ldquo;Je lis avec &eacute;motion vos vers superbes; c&rsquo;est
un reflet de gloire que vous m&rsquo;envoyez.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr
Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s compliment was very like Mr Arnold&rsquo;s
humour: &ldquo;Your father has been our most popular poet for
over forty years, and I am of opinion that he fully deserves his
reputation&rdquo;: such was &ldquo;Mat&rsquo;s sublime
waggery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tennyson heaped coals of fire on the other
poet, bidding him, as he liked to be bidden, to write more
poetry, not &ldquo;prose things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tennyson lived much
in the society of Browning and George Eliot, and made the
acquaintance of Renan.&nbsp; In December 1879 Mr and Mrs Kendal
produced <i>The Falcon</i>, which ran for sixty-seven nights; it
is &ldquo;an exquisite little poem in action,&rdquo; as Fanny
Kemble said.&nbsp; During a Continental tour Tennyson visited
Catullus&rsquo;s Sirmio: &ldquo;here he made his <i>Frater Ave
atque Vale</i>,&rdquo; and the poet composed his beautiful
salutation to the</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tenderest of Roman poets nineteen hundred
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1880 <i>Ballads and other Poems</i> proved that, like
Titian, the great poet was not to be defeated by the years.&nbsp;
<i>The First Quarrel</i> was in his most popular English
style.&nbsp; <i>Rizpah</i> deserved and received the splendid
panegyric of Mr Swinburne.&nbsp; <i>The Revenge</i> is probably
the finest of the patriotic pieces, and keeps green the memory of
an exploit the most marvellous in the annals of English
seamen.&nbsp; <i>The Village Wife</i> is a pendant worthy of
<i>The Northern Farmer</i>.&nbsp; The poem <i>In the
Children&rsquo;s Hospital</i> caused some irritation at the
moment, but there was only one opinion as to the <i>Defence of
Lucknow</i> and the beautiful re-telling of the Celtic <i>Voyage
of Maeldune</i>.&nbsp; The fragment of Homeric translation was
equally fortunate in choice of subject and in rendering.</p>
<p>In the end of 1880 the poet finished <i>The Cup</i>, which had
been worked on occasionally since he completed <i>The Falcon</i>
in 1880.&nbsp; The piece was read by the author to Sir Henry
Irving and his company, and it was found that the manuscript copy
needed few alterations to fit it for the stage.&nbsp; The scenery
and the acting of the protagonists are not easily to be
forgotten.&nbsp; The play ran for a hundred and thirty
nights.&nbsp; Sir Henry Irving had thought that <i>Becket</i>
(then unpublished) would prove too expensive, and could only be a
<i>succ&egrave;s d&rsquo;estime</i>.&nbsp; Tennyson had found out
that &ldquo;the worst of writing for the stage is, you must keep
some actor always in your mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this necessity
authors like Moli&egrave;re and Shakespeare were, of course,
resigned and familiar; they knew exactly how to deal with all
their means.&nbsp; But this part of the business of play-writing
must always be a cross to the poet who is not at one with the
world of the stage.</p>
<p>In <i>The Cup</i> Miss Ellen Terry made the strongest
impression, her part being noble and sympathetic, while Sir Henry
Irving had the ungrateful part of the villain.&nbsp; To be sure,
he was a villain of much complexity; and Tennyson thought that
his subtle blend of Roman refinement and intellectuality, and
barbarian, self-satisfied sensuality, was not &ldquo;hit
off.&rdquo;&nbsp; Synorix is, in fact, half-Greek, half-Celt,
with a Roman education, and the &ldquo;blend&rdquo; is rather too
remote for successful representation.&nbsp; The traditional
villain, from Iago downwards, is not apt to utter such poetry as
this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O Thou, that dost inspire the germ with
life,<br />
The child, a thread within the house of birth,<br />
And give him limbs, then air, and send him forth<br />
The glory of his father&mdash;Thou whose breath<br />
Is balmy wind to robe our bills with grass,<br />
And kindle all our vales with myrtle-blossom,<br />
And roll the golden oceans of our grain,<br />
And sway the long grape-bunches of our vines,<br />
And fill all hearts with fatness and the lust<br />
Of plenty&mdash;make me happy in my marriage!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year 1881 brought the death of another of the old
Cambridge friends, James Spedding, the biographer of Bacon; and
Carlyle also died, a true friend, if rather intermittent in his
appreciation of poetry.&nbsp; The real Carlyle did appreciate it,
but the Carlyle of attitude was too much of the iron Covenanter
to express what he felt.&nbsp; The poem <i>Despair</i> irritated
the earnest and serious readers of &ldquo;know-nothing
books.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poem expressed, dramatically, a mood like
another, a human mood not so very uncommon.&nbsp; A man ruined in
this world&rsquo;s happiness curses the faith of his youth, and
the unfaith of his reading and reflection, and tries to drown
himself.&nbsp; This is one conclusion of the practical syllogism,
and it is a free country.&nbsp; However, there were freethinkers
who did not think that Tennyson&rsquo;s kind of thinking ought to
be free.&nbsp; Other earnest persons objected to &ldquo;First
drink a health,&rdquo; in the re-fashioned song of <i>Hands all
Round</i>.&nbsp; They might have remembered a royal health drunk
in water an hour before the drinkers swept Mackay down the Pass
of Killiecrankie.&nbsp; The poet did not specify the fluid in
which the toast was to be carried, and the cup might be that
which &ldquo;cheers but not inebriates.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
common cup,&rdquo; as the remonstrants had to be informed,
&ldquo;has in all ages been the sacred symbol of
unity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Promise of May</i> was produced in November 1882, and
the poet was once more so unfortunate as to vex the
susceptibilities of advanced thinkers.&nbsp; The play is not a
masterpiece, and yet neither the gallery gods nor the Marquis of
Queensberry need have felt their withers wrung.&nbsp; The hero,
or villain, Edgar, is a perfectly impossible person, and
represents no kind of political, social, or economical
thinker.&nbsp; A man would give all other bliss and all his
worldly wealth for this, to waste his whole strength in one kick
upon this perfect prig.&nbsp; He employs the arguments of
evolution and so forth to justify the seduction of a little girl
of fifteen, and later, by way of making amends, proposes to
commit incest by marrying her sister.&nbsp; There have been
evolutionists, to be sure, who believed in promiscuity, like Mr
Edgar, as preferable to monogamy.&nbsp; But this only proves that
an evolutionist may fail to understand evolution.&nbsp; There be
also such folk as Stevenson calls
&ldquo;squirradicals&rdquo;&mdash;squires who say that &ldquo;the
land is the people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably no advocate of
promiscuity, and no squirradical, was present at the performances
of <i>The Promise of May</i>.&nbsp; But people of advanced minds
had got it into their heads that their doctrines were to be
attacked, so they went and made a hubbub in the sacred cause of
freedom of thought and speech.&nbsp; The truth is, that
controversial topics, political topics, ought not to be brought
into plays, much less into sermons.&nbsp; Tennyson meant Edgar
for &ldquo;nothing thorough, nothing sincere.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is
that venomous thing, the prig-scoundrel: he does not suit the
stage, and his place, if anywhere, is in the novel.&nbsp;
Advocates of marriage with a deceased wife&rsquo;s sister might
have applauded Edgar for wishing to marry the sister of a
mistress assumed to be deceased, but no other party in the State
wanted anything except the punching of Edgar&rsquo;s head by
Farmer Dobson.</p>
<p>In 1883 died Edward FitzGerald, the most kind, loyal, and, as
he said, crotchety of old and dear Cambridge friends.&nbsp; He
did not live to see the delightful poem which Tennyson had
written for him.&nbsp; In almost his latest letter he had
remarked, superfluously, that when he called the task of
translating <i>The Agamemnon</i> &ldquo;work for a poet,&rdquo;
he &ldquo;was not thinking of Mr Browning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1883 Tennyson was taken, with Mr Gladstone,
by Sir Donald Currie, for a cruise round the west coast of
Scotland, to the Orkneys, and to Copenhagen.&nbsp; The people of
Kirkwall conferred on the poet and the statesman the freedom of
the burgh, and Mr Gladstone, in an interesting speech, compared
the relative chances of posthumous fame of the poet and the
politician.&nbsp; Pericles is not less remembered than Sophocles,
though Shakespeare is more in men&rsquo;s minds than Cecil.&nbsp;
Much depends, as far as the statesmen are considered, on
contemporary historians.&nbsp; It is Thucydides who immortalises
Pericles.&nbsp; But it is improbable that the things which Mr
Gladstone did, and attempted, will be forgotten more rapidly than
the conduct and characters of, say, Burleigh or Lethington.</p>
<p>In 1884, after this voyage, with its royal functions and
celebrations at Copenhagen, a peerage was offered to the
poet.&nbsp; He &ldquo;did not want to alter his plain Mr,&rdquo;
and he must have known that, whether he accepted or refused, the
chorus of blame would be louder than that of applause.&nbsp;
Scott had desired &ldquo;such grinning honour as Sir Walter
hath&rdquo;; the title went well with the old name, and pleased
his love of old times.&nbsp; Tennyson had been blamed &ldquo;by
literary men&rdquo; for thrice evading a baronetcy, and he did
not think that a peerage would make smooth the lives of his
descendants.&nbsp; But he concluded, &ldquo;Why should I be
selfish and not suffer an honour (as Gladstone says) to be done
to literature in my name?&rdquo;&nbsp; Politically, he thought
that the Upper House, while it lasts, partly supplied the place
of the American &ldquo;referendum.&rdquo;&nbsp; He voted in July
1884 for the extension of the franchise, and in November stated
his views to Mr Gladstone in verse.&nbsp; In prose he wrote to Mr
Gladstone, &ldquo;I have a strong conviction that the more simple
the dealings of men with men, as well as of man with man,
are&mdash;the better,&rdquo; a sentiment which, perhaps, did not
always prevail with his friend.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s
reflections on the horror of Gordon&rsquo;s death are not
recorded.&nbsp; He introduced the idea of the Gordon Home for
Boys, and later supported it by a letter, &ldquo;Have we
forgotten Gordon?&rdquo; to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.&nbsp;
They who cannot forget Gordon must always be grateful to Tennyson
for providing this opportunity of honouring the greatest of an
illustrious clan, and of helping, in their degree, a scheme which
was dear to the heroic leader.</p>
<p>The poet, very naturally, was most averse to personal
appearance in public matters.&nbsp; Mankind is so fashioned that
the advice of a poet is always regarded as unpractical, and is
even apt to injure the cause which he advocates.&nbsp; Happily
there cannot be two opinions about the right way of honouring
Gordon.&nbsp; Tennyson&rsquo;s poem, <i>The Fleet</i>, was also
in harmony with the general sentiment.</p>
<p>In the last month of 1884 <i>Becket</i> was published.&nbsp;
The theme of Fair Rosamund had appealed to the poet in youth, and
he had written part of a lyric which he judiciously left
unpublished.&nbsp; It is given in his Biography.&nbsp; In 1877 he
had visited Canterbury, and had traced the steps of Becket to his
place of slaughter in the Cathedral.&nbsp; The poem was printed
in 1879, but not published till seven years later.&nbsp; In 1879
Sir Henry Irving had thought the play too costly to be produced
with more than a <i>succ&egrave;s d&rsquo;estime</i>; but in 1891
he put it on the stage, where it proved the most successful of
modern poetic dramas.&nbsp; As published it is, obviously, far
too long for public performance.&nbsp; It is not easy to
understand why dramatic poets always make their works so much too
long.&nbsp; The drama seems, by its very nature, to have a limit
almost as distinct as the limit of the sonnet.&nbsp; It is easy
to calculate how long a play for the stage ought to be, and we
might think that a poet would find the natural limit serviceable
to his art, for it inculcates selection, conciseness, and
concentration.&nbsp; But despite these advantages of the natural
form of the drama, modern poets, at least, constantly overflow
their banks.&nbsp; The author <i>ruit profusus</i>, and the
manager has to reduce the piece to feasible proportions, such as
it ought to have assumed from the first.</p>
<p><i>Becket</i> has been highly praised by Sir Henry Irving
himself, for its &ldquo;moments of passion and pathos, . . .
which, when they exist, atone to an audience for the endurance of
long acts.&rdquo;&nbsp; But why should the audience have such
long acts to endure?&nbsp; The reader, one fears, is apt to use
his privilege of skipping.&nbsp; The long speeches of Walter Map
and the immense period of Margery tempt the student to exercise
his agility.&nbsp; A &ldquo;chronicle play&rdquo; has the
privilege of wandering, but <i>Becket</i> wanders too far and too
long.&nbsp; The political details of the quarrel between Church
and State, with its domestic and international complexities, are
apt to fatigue the attention.&nbsp; Inevitable and insoluble as
the situation was, neither protagonist is entirely sympathetic,
whether in the play or in history.&nbsp; The struggle in Becket
between his love of the king and his duty to the Church (or what
he takes to be his duty) is nobly presented, and is truly
dramatic, while there is grotesque and terrible relief in the
banquet of the Beggars.&nbsp; In the scene of the assassination
the poet &ldquo;never stoops his wing,&rdquo; and there are
passages of tender pathos between Henry and Rosamund, while
Becket&rsquo;s keen memories of his early days, just before his
death, are moving.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Becket</i>.&nbsp; I
once was out with Henry in the days<br />
When Henry loved me, and we came upon<br />
A wild-fowl sitting on her nest, so still<br />
I reach&rsquo;d my hand and touch&rsquo;d; she did not stir;<br
/>
The snow had frozen round her, and she sat<br />
Stone-dead upon a heap of ice-cold eggs.<br />
Look! how this love, this mother, runs thro&rsquo; all<br />
The world God made&mdash;even the beast&mdash;the bird!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>John of Salisbury</i>.&nbsp; Ay, still a
lover of the beast and bird?<br />
But these arm&rsquo;d men&mdash;will you not hide yourself?<br />
Perchance the fierce De Brocs from Saltwood Castle,<br />
To assail our Holy Mother lest she brood<br />
Too long o&rsquo;er this hard egg, the world, and send<br />
Her whole heart&rsquo;s heat into it, till it break<br />
Into young angels.&nbsp; Pray you, hide yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Becket</i>.&nbsp; There was a little
fair-hair&rsquo;d Norman maid<br />
Lived in my mother&rsquo;s house: if Rosamund is<br />
The world&rsquo;s rose, as her name imports her&mdash;she<br />
Was the world&rsquo;s lily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>John of Salisbury</i>.&nbsp; Ay, and what
of her?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Becket</i>.&nbsp; She died of
leprosy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the part of Rosamund, her innocent ignorance especially,
is not very readily intelligible, not quite persuasive, and there
is almost a touch of the burlesque in her unexpected appearance
as a monk.&nbsp; To weave that old and famous story of love into
the terribly complex political intrigue was a task almost too
great.&nbsp; The character of Eleanor is perhaps more
successfully drawn in the Prologue than in the scene where she
offers the choice of the dagger or the bowl, and is interrupted,
in a startlingly unexpected manner, by the Archbishop
himself.&nbsp; The opportunities for scenic effects are
magnificent throughout, and must have contributed greatly to the
success on the stage.&nbsp; Still one cannot but regard the
published <i>Becket</i> as rather the marble from which the
statue may be hewn than as the statue itself.&nbsp; There are
fine scenes, powerful and masterly drawing of character in Henry,
Eleanor, and Becket, but there is a want of concentration, due,
perhaps, to the long period of time covered by the action.&nbsp;
So, at least, it seems to a reader who has admitted his sense of
incompetency in the dramatic region.&nbsp; The acuteness of the
poet&rsquo;s power of historical intuition was attested by Mr J.
R. Green and Mr Bryce.&nbsp; &ldquo;One cannot imagine,&rdquo;
said Mr Bryce, &ldquo;a more vivid, a more perfectly faithful
picture than it gives both of Henry and Thomas.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Tennyson&rsquo;s portraits of these two &ldquo;go beyond and
perfect history.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s sympathy ought,
perhaps, to have been, if not with the false and ruffianly Henry,
at least with Henry&rsquo;s side of the question.&nbsp; For
Tennyson had made Harold leave</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;To England<br />
My legacy of war against the Pope<br />
From child to child, from Pope to Pope, from age to age,<br />
Till the sea wash her level with her shores,<br />
Or till the Pope be Christ&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

194</span>IX.<br />
LAST YEARS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> end of 1884 saw the publication
of <i>Tiresias and other Poems</i>, dedicated to &ldquo;My good
friend, Robert Browning,&rdquo; and opening with the beautiful
verses to one who never was Mr Browning&rsquo;s friend, Edward
FitzGerald.&nbsp; The volume is rich in the best examples of
Tennyson&rsquo;s later work.&nbsp; <i>Tiresias</i>, the monologue
of the aged seer, blinded by excess of light when he beheld
Athene unveiled, and under the curse of Cassandra, is worthy of
the author who, in youth, wrote <i>&OElig;none</i> and
<i>Ulysses</i>.&nbsp; Possibly the verses reflect
Tennyson&rsquo;s own sense of public indifference to the voice of
the poet and the seer.&nbsp; But they are of much earlier date
than the year of publication:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;For when the crowd would
roar<br />
For blood, for war, whose issue was their doom,<br />
To cast wise words among the multitude<br />
Was flinging fruit to lions; nor, in hours<br />
Of civil outbreak, when I knew the twain<br />
Would each waste each, and bring on both the yoke<br />
Of stronger states, was mine the voice to curb<br />
The madness of our cities and their kings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who ever turn&rsquo;d upon his heel to hear<br />
My warning that the tyranny of one<br />
Was prelude to the tyranny of all?<br />
My counsel that the tyranny of all<br />
Led backward to the tyranny of one?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This power hath work&rsquo;d no good to aught that
lives.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conclusion was a favourite with the author, and his blank
verse never reached a higher strain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But for
me,<br />
I would that I were gather&rsquo;d to my rest,<br />
And mingled with the famous kings of old,<br />
On whom about their ocean-islets flash<br />
The faces of the Gods&mdash;the wise man&rsquo;s word,<br />
Here trampled by the populace underfoot,<br />
There crown&rsquo;d with worship&mdash;and these eyes will
find<br />
The men I knew, and watch the chariot whirl<br />
About the goal again, and hunters race<br />
The shadowy lion, and the warrior-kings,<br />
In height and prowess more than human, strive<br />
Again for glory, while the golden lyre<br />
Is ever sounding in heroic ears<br />
Heroic hymns, and every way the vales<br />
Wind, clouded with the grateful incense-fume<br />
Of those who mix all odour to the Gods<br />
On one far height in one far-shining fire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows the pathetic piece on FitzGerald&rsquo;s death,
and the prayer, not unfulfilled&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That,
when I from hence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall fade with him into the unknown,<br />
My close of earth&rsquo;s experience<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May prove as peaceful as his own.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Ancient Sage</i>, with its lyric interludes, is one of
Tennyson&rsquo;s meditations on the mystery of the world and of
existence.&nbsp; Like the poet himself, the Sage finds a gleam of
light and hope in his own subjective experiences of some
unspeakable condition, already recorded in <i>In
Memoriam</i>.&nbsp; The topic was one on which he seems to have
spoken to his friends with freedom:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And more, my son! for more than once when
I<br />
Sat all alone, revolving in myself<br />
The word that is the symbol of myself,<br />
The mortal limit of the Self was loosed,<br />
And past into the Nameless, as a cloud<br />
Melts into Heaven.&nbsp; I touch&rsquo;d my limbs, the limbs<br
/>
Were strange not mine&mdash;and yet no shade of doubt,<br />
But utter clearness, and thro&rsquo; loss of Self<br />
The gain of such large life as match&rsquo;d with ours<br />
Were Sun to spark&mdash;unshadowable in words,<br />
Themselves but shadows of a shadow-world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poet&rsquo;s habit of</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Revolving
in myself<br />
The word that is the symbol of myself&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is, of dwelling on the sound of his own name, was
familiar to the Arabs.&nbsp; M. Lef&eacute;bure has drawn my
attention to a passage in the works of a medi&aelig;val Arab
philosopher, Ibn Khaldoun: <a name="citation196"></a><a
href="#footnote196" class="citation">[196]</a> &ldquo;To arrive
at the highest degree of inspiration of which he is capable, the
diviner should have recourse to the use of certain phrases marked
by a peculiar cadence and parallelism.&nbsp; Thus he emancipates
his mind from the influence of the senses, and is enabled to
attain an imperfect contact with the spiritual
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ibn Khaldoun regards the
&ldquo;contact&rdquo; as extremely &ldquo;imperfect.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He describes similar efforts made by concentrating the gaze on a
mirror, a bowl of water, or the like.&nbsp; Tennyson was
doubtless unaware that he had stumbled accidentally on a method
of &ldquo;ancient sages.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psychologists will explain
his experience by the word &ldquo;dissociation.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is not everybody, however, who can thus dissociate himself.&nbsp;
The temperament of genius has often been subject to such
influence, as M. Lef&eacute;bure has shown in the modern
instances of George Sand and Alfred de Musset: we might add
Shelley, Goethe, and even Scott.</p>
<p>The poet&rsquo;s versatility was displayed in the appearance
with these records of &ldquo;weird seizures&rdquo;, of the Irish
dialect piece <i>To-morrow</i>, the popular <i>Spinster&rsquo;s
Sweet-Arts</i>, and the <i>Locksley Hall Sixty Years
After</i>.&nbsp; The old fire of the versification is unabated,
but the hero has relapsed on the gloom of the hero of
<i>Maud</i>.&nbsp; He represents himself, of course, not
Tennyson, or only one of the moods of Tennyson, which were
sometimes black enough.&nbsp; A very different mood chants the
<i>Charge of the Heavy Brigade</i>, and speaks of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Green Sussex fading into blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With one gray glimpse of sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lines <i>To Virgil</i> were written at the request of the
Mantuans, by the most Virgilian of all the successors of the</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wielder of the stateliest measure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ever moulded by the lips of man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never was Tennyson more Virgilian than in this unmatched
panegyric, the sum and flower of criticism of that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Golden branch amid the shadows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; kings and realms that pass to rise no
more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hardly less admirable is the tribute to Catullus, and the old
poet is young again in the bird-song of <i>Early
Spring</i>.&nbsp; The lines on <i>Poets and their
Bibliographies</i>, with <i>The Dead Prophet</i>, express
Tennyson&rsquo;s lifelong abhorrence of the critics and
biographers, whose joy is in the futile and the unimportant, in
personal gossip and the sweepings of the studio, the salvage of
the wastepaper basket.&nbsp; The <i>Prefatory Poem to my
Brother&rsquo;s Sonnets</i> is not only touching in itself, but
proves that the poet can &ldquo;turn to favour and to
prettiness&rdquo; such an affliction as the ruinous summer of
1879.</p>
<p>The year 1880 brought deeper distress in the death of the
poet&rsquo;s son Lionel, whose illness, begun in India, ended
fatally in the Red Sea.&nbsp; The interest of the following years
was mainly domestic.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s health, hitherto
robust, was somewhat impaired in 1888, but his vivid interest in
affairs and in letters was unabated.&nbsp; He consoled himself
with Virgil, Keats, Wordsworth, Gibbon, Euripides, and Mr
Leaf&rsquo;s speculations on the composite nature of the
<i>Iliad</i>, in which Coleridge, perhaps alone among poets,
believed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Tennyson to Mr Leaf;
&ldquo;I never liked that theory of yours about the many
poets.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be at least as easy to prove that
there were many authors of <i>Ivanhoe</i>, or perhaps it would be
a good deal more easy.&nbsp; However, he admitted that three
lines which occur both in the Eighth and the Sixteenth Books of
the <i>Iliad</i> are more appropriate in the later book.&nbsp;
Similar examples might be found in his own poems.&nbsp; He still
wrote, in the intervals of a malady which brought him &ldquo;as
near death as a man could be without dying.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
an example of the great physical strength which, on the whole,
seems usually to accompany great mental power.&nbsp; The strength
may be dissipated by passion, or by undue labour, as in cases
easily recalled to memory, but neither cause had impaired the
vigour of Tennyson.&nbsp; Like Goethe, he lived out all his life;
and his eightieth birthday was cheered both by public and private
expressions of reverence and affection.</p>
<p>Of Tennyson&rsquo;s last three years on earth we may think, in
his own words, that his</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s latest eve
endured<br />
Nor settled into hueless grey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nature was as dear to him and as inspiring as of old; men and
affairs and letters were not slurred by his intact and energetic
mind.&nbsp; His <i>Demeter and other Poems</i>, with the
dedication to Lord Dufferin, appeared in the December of the
year.&nbsp; The dedication was the lament for the dead son and
the salutation to the Viceroy of India, a piece of resigned and
manly regret.&nbsp; The <i>Demeter and Persephone</i> is a modern
and tender study of the theme of the most beautiful Homeric
Hymn.&nbsp; The ancient poet had no such thought of the restored
Persephone as that which impels Tennyson to describe her</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Faint as a climate-changing bird that
flies<br />
All night across the darkness, and at dawn<br />
Falls on the threshold of her native land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spring, the restored Persephone, comes more vigorous and
joyous to the shores of the &AElig;gean than to ours.&nbsp; All
Tennyson&rsquo;s own is Demeter&rsquo;s awe of those
&ldquo;imperial disimpassioned eyes&rdquo; of her daughter, come
from the bed and the throne of Hades, the Lord of many
guests.&nbsp; The hymn, happy in its ending, has no thought of
the grey heads of the Fates, and their answer to the goddess
concerning &ldquo;fate beyond the Fates,&rdquo; and the breaking
of the bonds of Hades.&nbsp; The ballad of <i>Owd Ro&auml;</i> is
one of the most spirited of the essays in dialect to which
Tennyson had of late years inclined.&nbsp; <i>Vastness</i> merely
expresses, in terms of poetry, Tennyson&rsquo;s conviction that,
without immortality, life is a series of worthless
contrasts.&nbsp; An opposite opinion may be entertained, but a
man has a right to express his own, which, coming from so great a
mind, is not undeserving of attention; or, at least, is hardly
deserving of reproof.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s idea is also stated
thus in <i>The Ring</i>, in terms which perhaps do not fall below
the poetical; or, at least, do not drop into &ldquo;the utterly
unpoetical&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Ghost in Man, the Ghost that once was
Man,<br />
But cannot wholly free itself from Man,<br />
Are calling to each other thro&rsquo; a dawn<br />
Stranger than earth has ever seen; the veil<br />
Is rending, and the Voices of the day<br />
Are heard across the Voices of the dark.<br />
No sudden heaven, nor sudden hell, for man,<br />
But thro&rsquo; the Will of One who knows and rules&mdash;<br />
And utter knowledge is but utter love&mdash;<br />
&AElig;onian Evolution, swift or slow,<br />
Thro&rsquo; all the Spheres&mdash;an ever opening height,<br />
An ever lessening earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Ring</i> is, in fact, a ghost story based on a legend
told by Mr Lowell about a house near where he had once lived; one
of those houses vexed by</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A footstep, a low throbbing in the
walls,<br />
A noise of falling weights that never fell,<br />
Weird whispers, bells that rang without a hand,<br />
Door-handles turn&rsquo;d when none was at the door,<br />
And bolted doors that open&rsquo;d of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These phenomena were doubtless caused by rats and water-pipes,
but they do not destroy the pity and the passion of the
tale.&nbsp; The lines to Mary Boyle are all of the normal world,
and worthy of a poet&rsquo;s youth and of the spring.&nbsp;
<i>Merlin and the Gleam</i> is the spiritual allegory of the
poet&rsquo;s own career:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Arthur had vanish&rsquo;d<br />
I knew not whither,<br />
The king who loved me,<br />
And cannot die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So at last</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;All but in Heaven<br />
Hovers The Gleam,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>whither the wayfarer was soon to follow.&nbsp; There is a
marvellous hope and pathos in the melancholy of these all but the
latest songs, reminiscent of youth and love, and even of the dim
haunting memories and dreams of infancy.&nbsp; No other English
poet has thus rounded all his life with music.&nbsp; Tennyson was
in his eighty-first year, when there &ldquo;came in a
moment&rdquo; the crown of his work, the immortal lyric,
<i>Crossing the Bar</i>.&nbsp; It is hardly less majestic and
musical in the perfect Greek rendering by his brother-in-law, Mr
Lushington.&nbsp; For once at least a poem has been &ldquo;poured
from the golden to the silver cup&rdquo; without the spilling of
a drop.&nbsp; The new book&rsquo;s appearance was coincident with
the death of Mr Browning, &ldquo;so loving and
appreciative,&rdquo; as Lady Tennyson wrote; a friend, not a
rival, however the partisans of either poet might strive to stir
emulation between two men of such lofty and such various
genius.</p>
<h2><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>X.<br />
1890.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1889 the poet&rsquo;s
health had permitted him to take long walks on the sea-shore and
along the cliffs, one of which, by reason of its whiteness, he
had named &ldquo;Taliessin,&rdquo; &ldquo;the splendid
brow.&rdquo;&nbsp; His mind ran on a poem founded on an Egyptian
legend (of which the source is not mentioned), telling how
&ldquo;despair and death came upon him who was mad enough to try
to probe the secret of the universe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also thought
of a drama on Tristram, who, in the Idylls, is treated with
brevity, and not with the sympathy of the old writer who cries,
&ldquo;God bless Tristram the knight: he fought for
England!&rdquo;&nbsp; But early in 1890 Tennyson suffered from a
severe attack of influenza.&nbsp; In May Mr Watts painted his
portrait, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Divinely through all hindrance found the
man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tennyson was a great admirer of Miss Austen&rsquo;s novels:
&ldquo;The realism and life-likeness of Miss Austen&rsquo;s
<i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> come nearest to those of
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Shakespeare, however, is a sun to which Jane
Austen, though a bright and true little world, is but an
asteroid.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was therefore pleased to find
apple-blossoms co-existing with ripe strawberries on June 28, as
Miss Austen has been blamed, by minute philosophers, for
introducing this combination in the garden party in
<i>Emma</i>.&nbsp; The poet, like most of the good and great,
read novels eagerly, and excited himself over the confirmation of
an adult male in a story by Miss Yonge.&nbsp; Of Scott,
&ldquo;the most chivalrous literary figure of the century, and
the author with the widest range since Shakespeare,&rdquo; he
preferred <i>Old Mortality</i>, and it is a good choice.&nbsp; He
hated &ldquo;morbid and introspective tales, with their oceans of
sham philosophy.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this time, with catholic taste,
he read Mr Stevenson and Mr Meredith, Miss Braddon and Mr Henry
James, Ouida and Mr Thomas Hardy; Mr Hall Caine and Mr Anstey;
Mrs Oliphant and Miss Edna Lyall.&nbsp; Not everybody can peruse
all of these very diverse authors with pleasure.&nbsp; He began
his poem on the Roman gladiatorial combats; indeed his years,
fourscore and one, left his intellectual eagerness as unimpaired
as that of Goethe.&nbsp; &ldquo;A crooked share,&rdquo; he said
to the Princess Louise, &ldquo;may make a straight
furrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;One afternoon he had a long waltz
with M&mdash; in the ballroom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Speaking of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All the charm of all the Muses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Often flowering in a lonely word&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in Virgil, he adduced, rather strangely, the <i>cunctantem
ramum</i>, said of the Golden Bough, in the Sixth
&AElig;neid.&nbsp; The choice is odd, because the Sibyl has just
told &AElig;neas that, if he be destined to pluck the branch of
gold, <i>ipse volens facilisque sequetur</i>, &ldquo;it will come
off of its own accord,&rdquo; like the sacred <i>ti</i> branches
of the Fijians, which bend down to be plucked for the Fire
rite.&nbsp; Yet, when the predestined &AElig;neas tries to pluck
the bough of gold, it yields <i>reluctantly</i>
(<i>cunctantem</i>), contrary to what the Sibyl has
foretold.&nbsp; Mr Conington, therefore, thought the phrase a
slip on the part of Virgil.&nbsp; &ldquo;People accused Virgil of
plagiarising,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if a man made it his own
there was no harm in that (look at the great poets, Shakespeare
included).&rdquo;&nbsp; Tennyson, like Virgil, made much that was
ancient his own; his verses are often, and purposefully, a mosaic
of classical reminiscences.&nbsp; But he was vexed by the hunters
after remote and unconscious resemblances, and far-fetched
analogies between his lines and those of others.&nbsp; He
complained that, if he said that the sun went down, a parallel
was at once cited from Homer, or anybody else, and he used a very
powerful phrase to condemn critics who detected such
repetitions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The moanings of the homeless
sea,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;moanings&rdquo; from Horace,
&ldquo;homeless&rdquo; from Shelley.&nbsp; &ldquo;As if no one
else had ever heard the sea moan except Horace!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Tennyson&rsquo;s mixture of memory and forgetfulness was not so
strange as that of Scott, and when he adapted from the Greek,
Latin, or Italian, it was of set purpose, just as it was with
Virgil.&nbsp; The beautiful lines comparing a girl&rsquo;s eyes
to bottom agates that seem to</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wave and float<br />
In crystal currents of clear running seas,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he invented while bathing in Wales.&nbsp; It was his habit, to
note down in verse such similes from nature, and to use them when
he found occasion.&nbsp; But the higher criticism, analysing the
simile, detected elements from Shakespeare and from Beaumont and
Fletcher.</p>
<p>In June 1891 the poet went on a tour in Devonshire, and began
his <i>Akbar</i>, and probably wrote <i>June Bracken and
Heather</i>; or perhaps it was composed when &ldquo;we often sat
on the top of Blackdown to watch the sunset.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
wrote to Mr Kipling&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The oldest to the youngest singer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That England bore&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(to alter Mr Swinburne&rsquo;s lines to Landor), praising his
<i>Flag of England</i>.&nbsp; Mr Kipling replied as &ldquo;the
private to the general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early in 1892 <i>The Foresters</i> was successfully produced
at New York by Miss Ada Rehan, the music by Sir Arthur Sullivan,
and the scenery from woodland designs by Whymper.&nbsp; Robin
Hood (as we learn from Mark Twain) is a favourite hero with the
youth of America.&nbsp; Mr Tom Sawyer himself took, in Mark
Twain&rsquo;s tale, the part of the bold outlaw.</p>
<p><i>The Death of &OElig;none</i> was published in 1892, with
the dedication to the Master of Balliol&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Read a Grecian tale
retold<br />
Which, cast in later Grecian mould,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quintus Calaber<br />
Somewhat lazily handled of old.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quintus Calaber, more usually called Quintus Smyrn&aelig;us,
is a writer of perhaps the fourth century of our era.&nbsp; About
him nothing, or next to nothing, is known.&nbsp; He told, in so
late an age, the conclusion of the Tale of Troy, and (in the
writer&rsquo;s opinion) has been unduly neglected and
disdained.&nbsp; His manner, I venture to think, is more Homeric
than that of the more famous and doubtless greater Alexandrian
poet of the Argonautic cycle, Apollonius Rhodius, his senior by
five centuries.&nbsp; His materials were probably the ancient and
lost poems of the Epic Cycle, and the story of the death of
&OElig;none may be from the <i>Little Iliad</i> of Lesches.&nbsp;
Possibly parts of his work may be textually derived from the
Cyclics, but the topic is very obscure.&nbsp; In Quintus, Paris,
after encountering evil omens on his way, makes a long speech,
imploring the pardon of the deserted &OElig;none.&nbsp; She
replies, not with the Tennysonian brevity; she sends him back to
the helpless arms of her rival, Helen.&nbsp; Paris dies on the
hills; never did Helen see him returning.&nbsp; The wood-nymphs
bewail Paris, and a herdsman brings the bitter news to Helen, who
chants her lament.&nbsp; But remorse falls on &OElig;none.&nbsp;
She does not go</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Slowly
down<br />
By the long torrent&rsquo;s ever-deepened roar,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but rushes &ldquo;swift as the wind to seek and spring upon
the pyre of her lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fate and Aphrodite drive her
headlong, and in heaven Selene, remembering Endymion, bewails the
lot of her sister in sorrow.&nbsp; &OElig;none reaches the
funeral flame, and without a word or a cry leaps into her
husband&rsquo;s arms, the wild Nymphs wondering.&nbsp; The lovers
are mingled in one heap of ashes, and these are bestowed in one
vessel of gold and buried in a howe.&nbsp; This is the story
which the poet rehandled in his old age, completing the work of
his happy youth when he walked with Hallam in the Pyrenean hills,
that were to him as Ida.&nbsp; The romance of &OElig;none and her
death condone, as even Homer was apt to condone, the sins of
beautiful Paris, whom the nymphs lament, despite the evil that he
has wrought.&nbsp; The silence of the veiled &OElig;none, as she
springs into her lover&rsquo;s last embrace, is perhaps more
affecting and more natural than Tennyson&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She lifted up a voice<br
/>
Of shrill command, &lsquo;Who burns upon the
pyre?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>St Telemachus</i> has the old splendour and vigour of
verse, and, though written so late in life, is worthy of the
poet&rsquo;s prime:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Eve after eve that
haggard anchorite<br />
Would haunt the desolated fane, and there<br />
Gaze at the ruin, often mutter low<br />
&lsquo;Vicisti Galil&aelig;e&rsquo;; louder again,<br />
Spurning a shatter&rsquo;d fragment of the God,<br />
&lsquo;Vicisti Galil&aelig;e!&rsquo; but&mdash;when now<br />
Bathed in that lurid crimson&mdash;ask&rsquo;d &lsquo;Is earth<br
/>
On fire to the West? or is the Demon-god<br />
Wroth at his fall?&rsquo; and heard an answer &lsquo;Wake<br />
Thou deedless dreamer, lazying out a life<br />
Of self-suppression, not of selfless love.&rsquo;<br />
And once a flight of shadowy fighters crost<br />
The disk, and once, he thought, a shape with wings<br />
Came sweeping by him, and pointed to the West,<br />
And at his ear he heard a whisper &lsquo;Rome,&rsquo;<br />
And in his heart he cried &lsquo;The call of God!&rsquo;<br />
And call&rsquo;d arose, and, slowly plunging down<br />
Thro&rsquo; that disastrous glory, set his face<br />
By waste and field and town of alien tongue,<br />
Following a hundred sunsets, and the sphere<br />
Of westward-wheeling stars; and every dawn<br />
Struck from him his own shadow on to Rome.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Foot-sore, way-worn, at length he touch&rsquo;d his
goal,<br />
The Christian city.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Akbar&rsquo;s Dream</i> may be taken, more or less, to
represent the poet&rsquo;s own theology of a race seeking after
God, if perchance they may find Him, and the closing Hymn was a
favourite with Tennyson.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;It is a
magnificent metre&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Hymn</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p>Once again thou flamest heavenward, once again we see thee
rise.<br />
Every morning is thy birthday gladdening human hearts and
eyes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Every morning here we greet it, bowing lowly down
before thee,<br />
Thee the Godlike, thee the changeless in thine ever-changing
skies.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II.</p>
<p>Shadow-maker, shadow-slayer, arrowing light from clime to
clime,<br />
Hear thy myriad laureates hail thee monarch in their woodland
rhyme.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Warble bird, and open flower, and, men, below the
dome of azure<br />
Kneel adoring Him the Timeless in the flame that measures
Time!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this final volume the poet cast his handful of incense on
the altar of Scott, versifying the tale of <i>Il Bizarro</i>,
which the dying Sir Walter records in his Journal in Italy.&nbsp;
<i>The Churchwarden and the Curate</i> is not inferior to the
earlier peasant poems in its expression of shrewdness, humour,
and superstition.&nbsp; A verse of <i>Poets and Critics</i> may
be taken as the poet&rsquo;s last word on the old futile
quarrel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This thing, that thing is the rage,<br />
Helter-skelter runs the age;<br />
Minds on this round earth of ours<br />
Vary like the leaves and flowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fashion&rsquo;d after certain laws;<br />
Sing thou low or loud or sweet,<br />
All at all points thou canst not meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some will pass and some will pause.</p>
<p>What is true at last will tell:<br />
Few at first will place thee well;<br />
Some too low would have thee shine,<br />
Some too high&mdash;no fault of thine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold thine own, and work thy will!<br />
Year will graze the heel of year,<br />
But seldom comes the poet here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Critic&rsquo;s rarer still.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still the lines hold good&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Some too low would have thee shine,<br />
Some too high&mdash;no fault of thine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The end was now at hand.&nbsp; A sense of weakness was felt by
the poet on September 3, 1892: on the 28th his family sent for
Sir Andrew Clark; but the patient gradually faded out of life,
and expired on Thursday, October 6, at 1.35 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&nbsp; To the very last he had
Shakespeare by him, and his windows were open to the sun; on the
last night they were flooded by the moonlight.&nbsp; The
description of the final scenes must be read in the Biography by
the poet&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; &ldquo;His patience and quiet
strength had power upon those who were nearest and dearest to
him; we felt thankful for the love and the utter peace of it
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The life after death,&rdquo; Tennyson
had said just before his fatal illness, &ldquo;is the cardinal
point of Christianity.&nbsp; I believe that God reveals Himself
in every individual soul; and my idea of Heaven is the perpetual
ministry of one soul to another.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had lived the
life of heaven upon earth, being in all his work a minister of
things honourable, lovely, consoling, and ennobling to the souls
of others, with a ministry which cannot die.&nbsp; His body
sleeps next to that of his friend and fellow-poet, Robert
Browning, in front of Chaucer&rsquo;s monument in the Abbey.</p>

LAST CHAPTER.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;O, <span class="smcap">that</span> Press will get hold
of me now,&rdquo; Tennyson said when he knew that his last hour
was at hand.&nbsp; He had a horror of personal tattle, as even
his early poems declare&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For now the Poet cannot die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor leave his music as of old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But round him ere he scarce be cold<br />
Begins the scandal and the cry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But no &ldquo;carrion-vulture&rdquo; has waited</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To tear his heart before the
crowd.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About Tennyson, doubtless, there is much anecdotage: most of
the anecdotes turn on his shyness, his really exaggerated hatred
of personal notoriety, and the odd and brusque things which he
would say when alarmed by effusive strangers.&nbsp; It has not
seemed worth while to repeat more than one or two of these
legends, nor have I sought outside the Biography by his son for
more than the biographer chose to tell.&nbsp; The readers who are
least interested in poetry are most interested in tattle about
the poet.&nbsp; It is the privilege of genius to retain the
freshness and simplicity, with some of the foibles, of the
child.&nbsp; When Tennyson read his poems aloud he was apt to be
moved by them, and to express frankly his approbation where he
thought it deserved.&nbsp; Only very rudimentary psychologists
recognised conceit in this freedom; and only the same set of
persons mistook shyness for arrogance.&nbsp; Effusiveness of
praise or curiosity in a stranger is apt to produce bluntness of
reply in a Briton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk d&mdash;d
nonsense, sir,&rdquo; said the Duke of Wellington to the gushing
person who piloted him, in his old age, across Piccadilly.&nbsp;
Of Tennyson Mr Palgrave says, &ldquo;I have known him silenced,
almost frozen, before the eager unintentional eyes of a girl of
fifteen.&nbsp; And under the stress of this nervous impulse
compelled to contradict his inner self (especially when under the
terror of leonisation . . . ), he was doubtless at times betrayed
into an abrupt phrase, a cold unsympathetic exterior; a
moment&rsquo;s &lsquo;defect of the rose.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Had
he not been sensitive in all things, he would have been less of a
poet.&nbsp; The chief criticism directed against his mode of life
is that he <i>was</i> sensitive and reserved, but he could and
did make himself pleasant in the society of <i>les pauvres
d&rsquo;esprit</i>.&nbsp; Curiosity alarmed him, and drove him
into his shell: strangers who met him in that mood carried away
false impressions, which developed into myths.&nbsp; As the
Master of Balliol has recorded, despite his shyness &ldquo;he was
extremely hospitable, often inviting not only his friends, but
the friends of his friends, and giving them a hearty
welcome.&nbsp; For underneath a sensitive exterior he was
thoroughly genial if he was understood.&rdquo;&nbsp; In these
points he was unlike his great contemporary, Browning; for
instance, Tennyson never (I think) was the Master&rsquo;s guest
at Balliol, mingling, like Browning, with the undergraduates, to
whom the Master&rsquo;s hospitality was freely extended.&nbsp;
Yet, where he was familiar, Tennyson was a gay companion, not
shunning jest or even paradox.&nbsp; &ldquo;As Dr Johnson says,
every man may be judged of by his laughter&rdquo;: but no Boswell
has chronicled the laughters of Tennyson.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never,
or hardly ever, made puns or witticisms&rdquo; (though one pun,
at least, endures in tradition), &ldquo;but always lived in an
attitude of humour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Jowett writes (and no
description of the poet is better than his)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>If I were to describe his outward appearance, I
should say that he was certainly unlike any one else whom I ever
saw.&nbsp; A glance at some of Watts&rsquo; portraits of him will
give, better than any description which can be expressed in
words, a conception of his noble mien and look.&nbsp; He was a
magnificent man, who stood before you in his native refinement
and strength.&nbsp; The unconventionality of his manners was in
keeping with the originality of his figure.&nbsp; He would
sometimes say nothing, or a word or two only, to the stranger who
approached him, out of shyness.&nbsp; He would sometimes come
into the drawing-room reading a book.&nbsp; At other times,
especially to ladies, he was singularly gracious and
benevolent.&nbsp; He would talk about the accidents of his own
life with an extraordinary freedom, as at the moment they
appeared to present themselves to his mind, the days of his
boyhood that were passed at Somersby, and the old school of
manners which he came across in his own neighbourhood: the days
of the &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; at Cambridge: the years which he
spent in London; the evenings enjoyed at the Cock Tavern, and
elsewhere, when he saw another side of life, not without a kindly
and humorous sense of the ridiculous in his
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; His repertory of stories was perfectly
inexhaustible; they were often about slight matters that would
scarcely bear repetition, but were told with such lifelike
reality, that they convulsed his hearers with laughter.&nbsp;
Like most story-tellers, he often repeated his favourites; but,
like children, his audience liked hearing them again and again,
and he enjoyed telling them.&nbsp; It might be said of him that
he told more stories than any one, but was by no means the
regular story-teller.&nbsp; In the commonest conversation he
showed himself a man of genius.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this description may be added another by Mr F. T.
Palgrave:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Every one will have seen men, distinguished in
some line of work, whose conversation (to take the old figure)
either &ldquo;smelt too strongly of the lamp,&rdquo; or lay quite
apart from their art or craft.&nbsp; What, through all these
years, struck me about Tennyson, was that whilst he never
deviated into poetical language as such, whether in rhetoric or
highly coloured phrase, yet throughout the substance of his talk
the same mode of thought, the same imaginative grasp of nature,
the same fineness and gentleness in his view of character, the
same forbearance and toleration, the <i>aurea mediocritas</i>
despised by fools and fanatics, which are stamped on his poetry,
were constantly perceptible: whilst in the easy and as it were
unsought choiceness, the conscientious and truth-loving precision
of his words, the same personal identity revealed itself.&nbsp;
What a strange charm lay here, how deeply illuminating the whole
character, as in prolonged intercourse it gradually revealed
itself!&nbsp; Artist and man, Tennyson was invariably true to
himself, or rather, in Wordsworth&rsquo;s phrase, he &ldquo;moved
altogether&rdquo;; his nature and his poetry being harmonious
aspects of the same soul; as botanists tell us that flower and
fruit are but transformations of root and stem and leafage.&nbsp;
We read how, in medi&aelig;val days, conduits were made to flow
with claret.&nbsp; But this was on great occasions only.&nbsp;
Tennyson&rsquo;s fountain always ran wine.</p>
<p>Once more: In Mme. R&eacute;camier&rsquo;s <i>salon</i>, I
have read, at the time when conversation was yet a fine art in
Paris, guests famous for <i>esprit</i> would sit in the twilight
round the stove, whilst each in turn let fly some sparkling
anecdote or bon-mot, which rose and shone and died out into
silence, till the next of the elect pyrotechnists was
ready.&nbsp; Good things of this kind, as I have said, were
plentiful in Tennyson&rsquo;s repertory.&nbsp; But what, to pass
from the materials to the method of his conversation, eminently
marked it was the continuity of the electric current.&nbsp; He
spoke, and was silent, and spoke again: but the circuit was
unbroken; there was no effort in taking up the thread, no sense
of disjunction.&nbsp; Often I thought, had he never written a
line of the poems so dear to us, his conversation alone would
have made him the most interesting companion known to me.&nbsp;
From this great and gracious student of humanity, what less,
indeed, could be expected?&nbsp; And if, as a converser, I were
to compare him with Socrates, as figured for us in the dialogues
of his great disciple, I think that I should have the assent of
that eminently valued friend of Tennyson&rsquo;s, whose long
labour of love has conferred English citizenship upon Plato.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have called him shy and sensitive in daily intercourse with
strangers, and as to criticism, he freely confessed that a midge
of dispraise could sting, while applause gave him little
pleasure.&nbsp; Yet no poet altered his verses so much in
obedience to censure unjustly or irritatingly stated, yet in
essence just.&nbsp; He readily rejected some of his
&ldquo;Juvenilia&rdquo; on Mr Palgrave&rsquo;s suggestion.&nbsp;
The same friend tells how well he took a rather fierce attack on
an unpublished piece, when Mr Palgrave &ldquo;owned that he could
not find one good line in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very few poets, or
even versifiers (fiercer they than poets are), would have
continued to show their virgin numbers to a friend so candid, as
Tennyson did.&nbsp; Perhaps most of the <i>genus irritabile</i>
will grant that spoken criticism, if unfavourable, somehow annoys
and stirs opposition in an author; probably because it confirms
his own suspicions about his work.&nbsp; Such criticism is almost
invariably just.&nbsp; But Campbell, when Rogers offered a
correction, &ldquo;bounced out of the room, with a &lsquo;Hang
it!&nbsp; I should like to see the man who would dare to correct
me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Jowett justly recognised in the life of Tennyson two
circumstances which made him other than, but for these, he would
have been.&nbsp; He had intended to do with the Arthurian subject
what he never did, &ldquo;in some way or other to have
represented in it the great religions of the world. . . . It is a
proof of Tennyson&rsquo;s genius that he should have thus early
grasped the great historical aspect of religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
intention was foiled, his early dream was broken, by the death of
Arthur Hallam, and by the coldness and contempt with which, at
the same period, his early poems were received.</p>
<p>Mr Jowett (who had a firm belief in the &ldquo;great
work&rdquo;) regretted the change of plan as to the Arthurian
topic, regretted it the more from his own interest in the History
of Religion.&nbsp; But we need not share the regrets.&nbsp; The
early plan for the Arthur (which Mr Jowett never saw) has been
published, and certainly the scheme could not have been executed
on these lines. <a name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a>&nbsp; Moreover, as the Master
observed, the work would have been premature in Tennyson&rsquo;s
youth, and, indeed, it would still be premature.&nbsp; The
comparative science of religious evolution is even now very
tentative, and does not yield materials of sufficient stability
for an epic, even if such an epic could be forced into the mould
of the Arthur legends, a feat perhaps impossible, and certainly
undesirable.&nbsp; A truly fantastic allegory must have been the
result, and it is fortunate that the poet abandoned the idea in
favour of more human themes.&nbsp; Moreover, he recognised very
early that his was not a Muse <i>de longue haleine</i>; that he
must be &ldquo;short.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may therefore feel certain
that his early sorrow and discouragement were salutary to him as
a poet, and as a man.&nbsp; He became more sympathetic, more
tender, and was obliged to put forth that stoical self-control,
and strenuous courage and endurance, through which alone his
poetic career was rendered possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had the
susceptibility of a child or a woman,&rdquo; says his friend;
&ldquo;he had also&rdquo; (it was a strange combination)
&ldquo;the strength of a giant or of a god.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without
these qualities he must have broken down between 1833 and 1842
into a hypochondriac, or a morose, if majestic, failure.&nbsp;
Poor, obscure, and unhappy, he overcame the world, and passed
from darkness into light.&nbsp; The &ldquo;poetic
temperament&rdquo; in another not gifted with his endurance and
persistent strength would have achieved ruin.</p>
<p>Most of us remember Taine&rsquo;s parallel between Tennyson
and Alfred de Musset.&nbsp; The French critic has no high
approval of Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;respectability&rdquo; and
long peaceful life, as compared with the wrecked life and genius
of Musset, <i>l&rsquo;enfant perdu</i> of love, wine, and
song.&nbsp; This is a theory like another, and is perhaps
attractive to the young.&nbsp; The poet must have strong
passions, or how can he sing of them: he must be tossed and
whirled in the stress of things, like Shelley&rsquo;s autumn
leaves;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ghosts from an enchanter
fleeing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at Burns, Byron, Musset, or even at Shelley&rsquo;s
earlier years, youth sees in them the true poets, &ldquo;sacred
things,&rdquo; but also &ldquo;light,&rdquo; as Plato says,
inspired to break their wings against the nature of existence,
and the <i>flammantia m&aelig;nia mundi</i>.&nbsp; But this is
almost a boyish idea, this idea that the true poet is the slave
of the passions, and that the poet who dominates them has none,
and is but a staid domestic animal, an ass browsing the common,
as somebody has written about Wordsworth.&nbsp; Certainly
Tennyson&rsquo;s was no &ldquo;passionless
perfection.&rdquo;&nbsp; He, like others, was tempted to beat
with ineffectual wings against the inscrutable nature of
life.&nbsp; He, too, had his dark hour, and was as subject to
temptation as they who yielded to the stress and died, or became
unhappy waifs, &ldquo;young men with a splendid
past.&rdquo;&nbsp; He must have known, no less than Musset, the
attractions of many a <i>paradis artificiel</i>, with its bright
visions, its houris, its offers of oblivion of pain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He had the look of one who had suffered greatly,&rdquo; Mr
Palgrave writes in his record of their first meeting in
1842.&nbsp; But he, like Goethe, Scott, and Victor Hugo, had
strength as well as passion and emotion; he came unscorched
through the fire that has burned away the wings of so many other
great poets.&nbsp; This was no less fortunate for the world than
for himself.&nbsp; Of his prolonged dark hour we know little in
detail, but we have seen that from the first he resisted the
Tempter; <i>Ulysses</i> is his <i>Retro Sathanas</i>!</p>
<p>About &ldquo;the mechanism of genius&rdquo; in Tennyson Mr
Palgrave has told us a little; more appears incidentally in his
biography.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was his way that when we had entered
on some scene of special beauty or grandeur, after enjoying it
together, he should always withdraw wholly from sight, and study
the view, as it were, in a little artificial solitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tennyson&rsquo;s poems, Mr Palgrave says, often arose in a
kind of <i>point de rep&egrave;re</i> (like those forms and
landscapes which seem to spring from a floating point of light,
beheld with closed eyes just before we sleep).&nbsp; &ldquo;More
than once he said that his poems sprang often from a
&lsquo;nucleus,&rsquo; some one word, maybe, or brief melodious
phrase, which had floated through the brain, as it were,
unbidden.&nbsp; And perhaps at once while walking they were
presently wrought into a little song.&nbsp; But if he did not
write it down at once the lyric fled from him
irrecoverably.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believed himself thus to have lost
poems as good as his best.&nbsp; It seems probable that this is a
common genesis of verses, good or bad, among all who write.&nbsp;
Like Dickens, and like most men of genius probably, he saw all
the scenes of his poems &ldquo;in his mind&rsquo;s
eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many authors do this, without the power of
making their readers share the vision; but probably few can
impart the vision who do not themselves &ldquo;visualise&rdquo;
with distinctness.&nbsp; We have seen, in the cases of <i>The
Holy Grail</i> and other pieces, that Tennyson, after long
meditating a subject, often wrote very rapidly, and with little
need of correction.&nbsp; He was born with &ldquo;style&rdquo;;
it was a gift of his genius rather than the result of conscious
elaboration.&nbsp; Yet he did use &ldquo;the file,&rdquo; of
which much is now written, especially for the purpose of
polishing away the sibilants, so common in our language.&nbsp; In
the nine years of silence which followed the little book of 1833
his poems matured, and henceforth it is probable that he altered
his verses little, if we except the modifications in <i>The
Princess</i>.&nbsp; Many slight verbal touches were made, or old
readings were restored, but important changes, in the way of
omission or addition, became rare.</p>
<p>Of nature Tennyson was scrupulously observant till his very
latest days, eagerly noting, not only &ldquo;effects,&rdquo; as a
painter does, but their causes, botanical or geological.&nbsp;
Had man been scientific from the beginning he would probably have
evolved no poetry at all; material things would not have been
endowed by him with life and passion; he would have told himself
no stories of the origins of stars and flowers, clouds and fire,
winds and rainbows.&nbsp; Modern poets have resented, like Keats
and Wordsworth, the destruction of the old prehistoric dreams by
the geologist and by other scientific characters.&nbsp; But it
was part of Tennyson&rsquo;s poetic originality to see the
beautiful things of nature at once with the vision of early
poetic men, and of moderns accustomed to the microscope,
telescope, spectrum analysis, and so forth.&nbsp; Thus Tennyson
received a double delight from the sensible universe, and it is a
double delight that he communicates to his readers.&nbsp; His
intellect was thus always active, even in apparent repose.&nbsp;
His eyes rested not from observing, or his mind from recording
and comparing, the beautiful familiar phenomena of earth and
sky.&nbsp; In the matter of the study of books we have seen how
deeply versed he was in certain of the Greek, Roman, and Italian
classics.&nbsp; Mr Jowett writes: &ldquo;He was what might be
called a good scholar in the university or public-school sense of
the term, . . . yet I seem to remember that he had his favourite
classics, such as Homer, and Pindar, and Theocritus. . . . He was
also a lover of Greek fragments.&nbsp; But I am not sure whether,
in later life, he ever sat down to read consecutively the
greatest works of &AElig;schylus and Sophocles, although he used
occasionally to dip into them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Greek dramatists,
in fact, seem to have affected Tennyson&rsquo;s work but
slightly, while he constantly reminds us of Virgil, Homer,
Theocritus, and even Persius and Horace.&nbsp; Medi&aelig;val
French, whether in poetry or prose, and the poetry of the
&ldquo;Pleiad&rdquo; seems to have occupied little of his
attention.&nbsp; Into the oriental literatures he
dipped&mdash;pretty deeply for his <i>Akbar</i>; and even his
<i>Locksley Hall</i> owed something to Sir William Jones&rsquo;s
version of &ldquo;the old Arabian <i>Moallakat</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The debt appears to be infinitesimal.&nbsp; He seems to have been
less closely familiar with Elizabethan poetry than might have
been expected: a number of his <i>obiter dicta</i> on all kinds
of literary points are recorded in the <i>Life</i> by Mr
Palgrave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s short tale, <i>My
Aunt Margaret&rsquo;s Mirror</i> (how little known!), he once
spoke of as the finest of all ghost or magical
stories.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Tennyson adds, &ldquo;<i>The
Tapestried Chamber</i> also he greatly admired.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both
are lost from modern view among the short pieces of the last
volumes of the <i>Waverley</i> novels.&nbsp; Of the poet&rsquo;s
interest in and attitude towards the more obscure pyschological
and psychical problems&mdash;to popular science
foolishness&mdash;enough has been said, but the remarks of
Professor Tyndall have not been cited:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>My special purpose in introducing this poem,
however, was to call your attention to a passage further on which
greatly interested me.&nbsp; The poem is, throughout, a
discussion between a believer in immortality and one who is
unable to believe.&nbsp; The method pursued is this.&nbsp; The
Sage reads a portion of the scroll, which he has taken from the
hands of his follower, and then brings his own arguments to bear
upon that portion, with a view to neutralising the scepticism of
the younger man.&nbsp; Let me here remark that I read the whole
series of poems published under the title &ldquo;Tiresias,&rdquo;
full of admiration for their freshness and vigour.&nbsp; Seven
years after I had first read them your father died, and you, his
son, asked me to contribute a chapter to the book which you
contemplate publishing.&nbsp; I knew that I had some small store
of references to my interview with your father carefully written
in ancient journals.&nbsp; On the receipt of your request, I
looked up the account of my first visit to Farringford, and
there, to my profound astonishment, I found described that
experience of your father&rsquo;s which, in the mouth of the
Ancient Sage, was made the ground of an important argument
against materialism and in favour of personal immortality
eight-and-twenty years afterwards.&nbsp; In no other poem during
all these years is, to my knowledge, this experience once alluded
to.&nbsp; I had completely forgotten it, but here it was recorded
in black and white.&nbsp; If you turn to your father&rsquo;s
account of the wonderful state of consciousness superinduced by
thinking of his own name, and compare it with the argument of the
Ancient Sage, you will see that they refer to one and the same
phenomenon.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Any words about Tennyson as a politician are apt to excite the
sleepless prejudice which haunts the political field.&nbsp; He
probably, if forced to &ldquo;put a name to it,&rdquo; would have
called himself a Liberal.&nbsp; But he was not a social
agitator.&nbsp; He never set a rick on fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;He held
aloof, in a somewhat detached position, from the great social
seethings of his age&rdquo; (Mr Frederic Harrison).&nbsp; But in
youth he helped to extinguish some flaming ricks.&nbsp; He spoke
of the &ldquo;many-headed beast&rdquo; (the reading public) in
terms borrowed from Plato.&nbsp; He had no higher esteem for mobs
than Shakespeare or John Knox professed, while his theory of
tyrants (in the case of Napoleon III. about 1852) was that of
Liberals like Mr Swinburne and Victor Hugo.&nbsp; Though to
modern enlightenment Tennyson may seem as great a Tory as Dr
Johnson, yet he had spoken his word in 1852 for the freedom of
France, and for securing England against the supposed designs of
a usurper (now fallen).&nbsp; He really believed, obsolete as the
faith may be, in guarding our own, both on land and sea.&nbsp;
Perhaps no Continental or American critic has ever yet dispraised
a poetical fellow-countryman merely for urging the duties of
national union and national defence.&nbsp; A critic, however,
writes thus of Tennyson: &ldquo;When our poet descends into the
arena of party polemics, in such things as <i>Riflemen</i>,
<i>Form</i>!&nbsp; <i>Hands all Round</i>, . . .&nbsp; <i>The
Fleet</i>, and other topical pieces dear to the Jingo soul, it is
not poetry but journalism.&rdquo;&nbsp; I doubt whether the
desirableness of the existence of a volunteer force and of a
fleet really is within the arena of <i>party</i> polemics.&nbsp;
If any party thinks that we ought to have no volunteers, and that
it is our duty to starve the fleet, what is that party&rsquo;s
name?&nbsp; Who cries, &ldquo;Down with the Fleet!&nbsp; Down
with National Defence!&nbsp; Hooray for the Disintegration of the
Empire!&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Tennyson was not a party man, but he certainly would have
opposed any such party.&nbsp; If to defend our homes and this
England be &ldquo;Jingoism,&rdquo; Tennyson, like Shakespeare,
was a Jingo.&nbsp; But, alas! I do not know the name of the party
which opposes Tennyson, and which wishes the invader to trample
down England&mdash;any invader will do for so philanthropic a
purpose.&nbsp; Except when resisting this unnamed party, the poet
seldom or never entered &ldquo;the arena of party
polemics.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tennyson could not have exclaimed, like
Squire Western, &ldquo;Hurrah for old England!&nbsp; Twenty
thousand honest Frenchmen have landed in Kent!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
undeniably did write verses (whether poetry or journalism)
tending to make readers take an unfavourable view of honest
invaders.&nbsp; If to do that is to be a &ldquo;Jingo,&rdquo; and
if such conduct hurts the feelings of any great English party,
then Tennyson was a Jingo and a partisan, and was, so far, a
rhymester, like Mr Kipling.&nbsp; Indeed we know that Tennyson
applauded Mr Kipling&rsquo;s <i>The English Flag</i>.&nbsp; So
the worst is out, as we in England count the worst.&nbsp; In
America and on the continent of Europe, however, a poet may be
proud of his country&rsquo;s flag without incurring rebuke from
his countrymen.&nbsp; Tennyson did not reckon himself a party
man; he believed more in political evolution than in political
revolution, with cataclysms.&nbsp; He was neither an Anarchist
nor a Home Ruler, nor a politician so generous as to wish England
to be laid defenceless at the feet of her foes.</p>
<p>If these sentiments deserve censure, in Tennyson, at least,
they claim our tolerance.&nbsp; He was not born in a generation
late enough to be truly Liberal.&nbsp; Old prejudices about
&ldquo;this England,&rdquo; old words from <i>Henry V.</i> and
<i>King John</i>, haunted his memory and darkened his vision of
the true proportions of things.&nbsp; We draw in prejudice with
our mother&rsquo;s milk.&nbsp; The mother of Tennyson had not
been an Agnostic or a Comtist; his father had not been a staunch
true-blue anti-Englander.&nbsp; Thus he inherited a certain bias
in favour of faith and fatherland, a bias from which he could
never emancipate himself.&nbsp; But <i>tout comprendre
c&rsquo;est tout pardonner</i>.&nbsp; Had Tennyson&rsquo;s birth
been later, we might find in him a more complete realisation of
our poetic ideal&mdash;might have detected less to blame or to
forgive.</p>
<p>With that apology we must leave the fame of Tennyson as a
politician to the clement consideration of an enlightened
posterity.&nbsp; I do not defend his narrow insularities, his
Jingoism, or the appreciable percentage of faith which blushing
analysis may detect in his honest doubt: these things I may
regret or condemn, but we ought not to let them obscure our view
of the Poet.&nbsp; He was led away by bad examples.&nbsp; Of all
Jingoes Shakespeare is the most unashamed, and next to him are
Drayton, Scott, and Wordsworth, with his</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, for one hour of that Dundee!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the years which followed the untoward affair of Waterloo
young Tennyson fell much under the influence of Shakespeare,
Wordsworth, and the other offenders, and these are extenuating
circumstances.&nbsp; By a curious practical paradox, where the
realms of poetry and politics meet, the Tory critics seem milder
of mood and more Liberal than the Liberal critics.&nbsp; Thus Mr
William Morris was certainly a very advanced political theorist;
and in theology Mr Swinburne has written things not easily
reconcilable with orthodoxy.&nbsp; Yet we find Divine-Right
Tories, who in literature are fervent admirers of these two
poets, and leave their heterodoxies out of account.&nbsp; But
many Liberal critics appear unable quite to forgive Tennyson
because he did not wish to starve the fleet, and because he held
certain very ancient, if obsolete, beliefs.&nbsp; Perhaps a
general amnesty ought to be passed, as far as poets are
concerned, and their politics and creeds should be left to
silence, where &ldquo;beyond these voices there is
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One remark, I hope, can excite no prejudice.&nbsp; The
greatest of the Gordons was a soldier, and lived in
religion.&nbsp; But the point at which Tennyson&rsquo;s memory is
blended with that of Gordon is the point of sympathy with the
neglected poor.&nbsp; It is to his wise advice, and to affection
for Gordon, that we owe the Gordon training school for poor
boys,&mdash;a good school, and good boys come out of that
academy.</p>
<p>The question as to Tennyson&rsquo;s precise rank in the
glorious roll of the Poets of England can never be determined by
us, if in any case or at any time such determinations can be
made.&nbsp; We do not, or should not, ask whether Virgil or
Lucretius, whether &AElig;schylus or Sophocles, is the greater
poet.&nbsp; The consent of mankind seems to place Homer and
Shakespeare and Dante high above all.&nbsp; For the rest no
prize-list can be settled.&nbsp; If influence among aliens is the
test, Byron probably takes, among our poets, the next rank after
Shakespeare.&nbsp; But probably there is no possible test.&nbsp;
In certain respects Shelley, in many respects Milton, in some
Coleridge, in some Burns, in the opinion of a number of persons
Browning, are greater poets than Tennyson.&nbsp; But for
exquisite variety and varied exquisiteness Tennyson is not
readily to be surpassed.&nbsp; At one moment he pleases the
uncritical mass of readers, in another mood he wins the verdict
of the <i>raffin&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; It is a success which scarce
any English poet but Shakespeare has excelled.&nbsp; His faults
have rarely, if ever, been those of flat-footed,
&ldquo;thick-ankled&rdquo; dulness; of rhetoric, of common-place;
rather have his defects been the excess of his qualities.&nbsp; A
kind of John Bullishness may also be noted, especially in
derogatory references to France, which, true or untrue, are out
of taste and keeping.&nbsp; But these errors could be removed by
the excision of half-a-dozen lines.&nbsp; His later work (as the
<i>Voyage of Maeldune</i>) shows a just appreciation of ancient
Celtic literature.&nbsp; A great critic, F. T. Palgrave, has
expressed perhaps the soundest appreciation of
Tennyson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It is for &ldquo;the days that remain&rdquo; to
bear witness to his real place in the great hierarchy, amongst
whom Dante boldly yet justly ranked himself.&nbsp; But if we look
at Tennyson&rsquo;s work in a twofold aspect,&mdash;<i>Here</i>,
on the exquisite art in which, throughout, his verse is clothed,
the lucid beauty of the form, the melody almost audible as music,
the mysterious skill by which the words used constantly strike as
the <i>inevitable</i> words (and hence, unforgettable), the
subtle allusive touches, by which a secondary image is suggested
to enrich the leading thought, as the harmonic
&ldquo;partials&rdquo; give richness to the note struck upon the
string; <i>There</i>, when we think of the vast fertility in
subject and treatment, united with happy selection of motive, the
wide range of character, the dramatic force of impersonation, the
pathos in every variety, the mastery over the comic and the
tragic alike, above all, perhaps, those phrases of luminous
insight which spring direct from imaginative observation of
Humanity, true for all time, coming from the heart to the
heart,&mdash;his work will probably be found to lie somewhere
between that of Virgil and Shakespeare: having its portion, if I
may venture on the phrase, in the inspiration of both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A professed enthusiast for Tennyson can add nothing to, and
take nothing from, these words of one who, though his friend, was
too truly a critic to entertain the admiration that goes beyond
idolatry.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
